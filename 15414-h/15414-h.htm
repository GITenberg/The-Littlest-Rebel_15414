<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The play, from which this book is written, was
in no sense of the word intended as a war
drama; for war is merely its background, and
always in the center stands a lonely little child.</p>

<p>War is its theme but not its purpose. War
breeds hatred, horror, pestilence and famine,
yet from its tears and ashes eventually must
rise the clean white spirit of HUMANITY.</p>

<p>The enmity between North and South is
dead; it sleeps with the fathers and the sons,
the brothers and the lovers, who died in a cause
which each believed was just.</p>

<p>Therefore this story deals, not with the right
or wrong of a lost confederacy, but with the
mercy and generosity, the chivalry and humanity
which lived in the hearts of the Blue and
Gray, a noble contrast to the grim brutality of
war.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The author is indebted to Mr. E.S. Moffat,
who has novelized the play directly from its
text, with the exception of that portion which
appeared as a short story under the same title
several years ago, treating of Virgie in the
overseer's cabin, and the endorsing of her pass
by Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison.</p>

<p>Young Mrs. Herbert Cary picked up her
work basket and slowly crossed the grass to
a shady bench underneath the trees. She must
go on with her task of planning a dress for
Virgie. But the prospect of making her
daughter something wearable out of the odds
and ends of nothing was not a happy one. In
fact, she was still poking through her basket
and frowning thoughtfully when a childish
voice came to her ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Virgie! Here I am. Out under the
trees.&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately came a sound of tumultuous
feet and Miss Virginia Houston Cary burst
upon the scene. She was a tot of seven with
sun touched hair and great dark eyes whose
witchery made her a piquant little fairy. In
spite of her mother's despair over her clothes
Virgie was dressed, or at least had been
dressed at breakfast time, in a clean white
frock, low shoes and white stockings, although
all now showed signs of strenuous usage.
Clutched to her breast as she ran up to her
mother's side was &quot;Susan Jemima,&quot; her one
beloved possession and her doll. Behind
Virgie came Sally Ann, her playmate, a slim,
barefooted mulatto girl whose faded, gingham
dress hung partly in tatters, halfway between
her knees and ankles. In one of Sally Ann's
hands, carried like a sword, was a pointed
stick; in the other, a long piece of blue wood-moss
from which dangled a bit of string.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mother,&quot; cried the small daughter of
the Carys, as she came up flushed and excited,
&quot;what do you reckon Sally Ann and me have
been playing out in the woods!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, dear!&quot; and Mrs. Cary's gentle hand
went up to lift the hair back from her daughter's
dampened forehead.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Blue Beard</i>!&quot; cried Virgie, with rounded
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Blue Beard!&quot; echoed her mother in astonishment
at this childish freak of amusement.</p>

<p>&quot;Not really&mdash;on this hot day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, hum,&quot; nodded Virgie emphatically.
&quot;You know he&mdash;he&mdash;he was the terriblest old
man that&mdash;that ever was. An' he had so many
wifses that&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say 'wives,' my darling. <i>Wives</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Sally Ann laughed and Virgie frowned.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I <i>thought</i> it was that, but Sally
Ann's older'n me and she said 'wifses.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh,&quot; grunted Sally Ann. &quot;Don' make
no differ'nce what you call 'em, des so he had
'em. Gor'n tell her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you know, Mother, Blue Beard had
such a bad habit of killin' his wives that&mdash;that
some of the ladies got so they&mdash;they almost
didn't like to marry him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gracious, what a state of affairs,&quot; cried
Mrs. Cary, in well feigned amazement at the
timidity of the various Mrs. Blue Beards.
&quot;And then&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the last time he got married to&mdash;to
another one&mdash;her name was Mrs. Fatima.
An'&mdash;an' I've been playin' <i>her</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And who played Blue Beard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sally Ann&mdash;an' she's just fine. Come
here, Sally Ann, an' let's show her. Kneel
down.&quot;</p>

<p>Clutching the piece of moss from Sally
Ann, Virgie ran behind the girl and put her
chubby arms around her neck. &quot;This is his
blue beard, Mother. Hold still, Sally Ann&mdash;<i>My
lord</i>, I mean&mdash;till I get it tied in the right
place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be keerful, Miss Virgie,&quot; advised the colored
girl. &quot;You's a-ticklin' my nose. I'se
gwine to sneeze ef yo' don't, and jes blow my
beard all away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't be such a baby,&quot; remonstrated
the earnest Miss Virginia, with a correcting
slap. &quot;S'pose you were a man an' had to wear
one all the time. Now! Stand up! Look,
Mother!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid of him already. He's so ferocious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't he? Oh, won't <i>you</i> play with us,
Mother? I'll&mdash;I'll let you be Mrs. Fatima.&quot;
And then, as her mother's face showed signs
of doubt as to her histrionic ability, &quot;If you
were <i>my</i> little girl, I'd do it in a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right, dear, of course I will; but I've
just remembered a bit of lace in your grandmother's
trunk in the attic. I believe it will
be exactly enough for the neck and sleeves of
your new dress.&quot; She smiled courageously as
she folded a piece of old silk she was remaking.
&quot;You and&mdash;&quot; she cast a glance at Sally Ann&mdash;&quot;your
respected brother-in-law can wait a few
moments, can't you? You might rehearse a
little more. With all this important audience
of solemn oaks you wouldn't want to make the
slightest slip in your parts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's so,&quot; agreed Virgie, raising her hands
and clasping her tiny fingers thoughtfully.
&quot;And I'll tell you what&mdash;we'll mark off the
castle walls around the bench where the window's
going to be. We ought to have a stage.
Come on Sal&mdash;I mean Blue Beard, pick up
some sticks quick.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary started, but turned back an instant:
&quot;By the way, have either of you seen
Uncle Billy. I' must find him, too, and plan
something for our lunch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I seen 'im early dis mawnin',&quot; piped Blue
Beard, &quot;makin' for de woods. I reckon he be
back pres'n'y.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; answered Virgie's mother, a
shadow creeping into her face as she went on
toward the house. Could Uncle Billy possibly
be leaving! The most trusted negro of all!
No&mdash;<i>never</i>! She would almost as soon doubt
the cause itself!</p>

<p>Three long years ago war had seemed a
thrilling, daring necessity. Caught in the
dreadful net of circumstance she had vowed
proudly in her own heart never to be less brave
than the bravest. In her ears still rang the
echo of that first ...</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Tara-tara!</i></p>

<p>From far away a faint fanfare of trumpets,
borne on brazen wings from the distant clamor
of the city's streets.</p>

<p><i>Tara-tara!</i></p>

<p>&quot;What's that&mdash;a bugle?&quot;</p>

<p><i>R-r-r-r-rum-dum!</i></p>

<p>&quot;And that&mdash;a drum?&quot;</p>

<p><i>Tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp</i>&mdash;the rolling thunder
of ten thousand feet.</p>

<p><i>War has been declared!</i></p>

<p>From North to South, the marching lines
fill the land&mdash;a sea of men whose flashing bayonets
glisten and glitter in the morning light.
With steady step and even rank, with thrill of
brass lunged band and screaming fife the regiments
sweep by&mdash;in front, the officers on their
dancing steeds&mdash;behind them, line after line of
youthful faces, chins in, chests out, the light of
victory already shining in their eyes.</p>

<p>In just this way the Nation's sons went
forth to fight in those first brave days of '61.
Just so they marched out, defiant, from South
and North alike, each side eager for the cause
he thought was right, with bright pennons
snapping in the breeze and bugles blowing
gayly and never a thought in any man's mind
but that <i>his</i> side would win and his own life be
spared.</p>

<p>And every woman, too, waving cheerful
farewell to valiant lines of marching gray or
sturdy ranks of blue, had hoped the same for
<i>her</i> side.</p>

<p>But in war there is always a reckoning to
pay. Always one contender driven to the wall,
his cities turned to ashes, his lands laid waste.
Always one depleted side which takes one last
desperate stand in the sight of blackened
homes and outraged fields and fights on
through ever darkening days until the inevitable
end is come.</p>

<p>And the end of the Confederacy was now
almost in sight. Three years of fighting and
the Seceding States had been cut in twain,
their armies widely separated by the Union
hosts. Advancing and retreating but always
fighting, month after month, year after year
the men in gray had come at last to the bitterest
period of it all&mdash;when the weakened South
was slowly breaking under the weight of her
brother foes&mdash;when the two greatest of the
armies battled on Virginia soil&mdash;battled and
passed to their final muster roll.</p>

<p>Of little need to tell of the privations which
the pivotal state of the Confederacy went
through. If it were true that Virginia had
been simply one vast arsenal where every inhabitant
had unfailingly done his part in making
war, it was also true that she had furnished
many of its greatest battlefields&mdash;and at what
a frightful cost.</p>

<p>Everywhere were the cruel signs of destruction
and want&mdash;in scanty larder, patched, refurbished
clothing, servantless homes&mdash;in
dismantled outhouses, broken fences and neglected,
brier-choked fields. Even the staples
of life were fast diminishing for every man
who could shoulder a gun had gone to fight
with Lee, and few animals were left and fewer
slaves.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Yet, for all the dismal outlook, Winter had
passed without actual disaster to the Confederate
arms and now that Spring had come the
plantation home of the Herbert Carys, twenty
miles below Richmond, had never had a fairer
setting. White-pillared and stately the old
Colonial mansion stood on one of the low,
emerald hills which roll back lazily from the
peaceful James. It was true that the flower
beds had been trampled down to ruin by alien
horse and heel, but the scent of the honeysuckle
clinging to those shining pillars only
seemed the sweeter for the loss, and whatever
else the forager might take, he could not rob
them of their gracious vista of hills and shimmering
river.</p>

<p>Across the broad driveway and up the steps
of the veranda passed Mrs. Cary, fairer than
had been the flowers, a true daughter of the oldtime
South, gentle and quiet eyed, her light
summer dress of the cheapest material, yet
deftly fashioned by her own fingers from
slightly opened neck, where an old brooch lay
against her soft throat, down to the dainty
spotless flounces lying above her petticoat of
crinoline.</p>

<p>Though her lips and eyes refused to betray
it even when there was no one to see, it was
with a very heavy heart that she mounted the
stairs to the attic, thinking, contriving, clutching
desperately at her fading hopes.</p>

<p>For good reason the plantation was very
silent on this warm spring morning. Where
only a year before dozens of soft eyed Jerseys
had ranged through the pastures and wood
lots there was now no sound of tinkling bells&mdash;one
after another the fine, blooded stock had
been requisitioned by a sad faced quartermaster
of the Army of Northern Virginia.
And one by one the fat porkers who had muzzled
greedily among the ears from the Cary
bins and who ought to have gone into the
smoke house had departed, squealing, to furnish
bone and sinew with which to repel the
invader. Saddest of all, the chicken coops
down by the deserted negro quarters were
quite as empty as the once teeming cabins
themselves. Poverty, grim and relentless, had
caught the Carys in its iron hand and behind
Poverty stood its far more frightening shadow&mdash;Starvation.</p>

<p>But in these gloomy thoughts she was not
entirely alone. All that troubled her and more,
though perhaps in a different way, passed
hourly through the old gray kinky head of
Uncle Billy who happened at this very moment
to be emerging stealthily from the woods below
the house. Slowly and deliberately he
made his way toward the front till he reached
a bench where he sat down under a tree to
ruminate over the situation and inspect the
feathered prize which he had lately acquired by
certain, devious means known only to Uncle
Billy. Wiping his forehead with his ragged
sleeve and holding the bird up by its tied feet
he regarded it with the eye of an expert, and
the fatigue of one who has been sorely put to
it in order to accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>&quot;It 'pears to me,&quot; said Uncle Billy, &quot;dat
des' when you needs 'em the mostest the chickens
goes to roosting higher 'n' higher.
Rooster&mdash;I wonder who you b'longs to.
Um-<i>um</i>!&quot; he murmured as he thoughtfully
sounded the rooster's well developed chest
through the feathers. &quot;From de feelin' of
you, my son, I 'spec' you was raise' by one er
de ol'es' fam'lies what is!&quot;</p>

<p>But Uncle Billy knew the fortunes of the
Cary family far too well to mourn over the
probable toughness of his booty, and as he rose
up from the seat and meandered toward the
kitchen, his old, wrinkled face broke into a
broad smile of satisfaction over the surprise
he had in store. &quot;Well&mdash;after I done parbile
you, I reckon Miss Hallie be mighty glad to
see you. Yas, <i>seh</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>But as Uncle Billy walked slowly along beside
the hedge which shielded the house on one
side he heard a sound which made him halt.
A young negro, coming from the rear, had
dodged behind the hedge and was trying to
keep out of his sight.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi, dar! You, Jeems Henry!&quot; shouted
Uncle Billy, instantly suspicious of such maneuvers.
&quot;Come heh! Hear <i>me</i>! Come heh!&quot;</p>

<p>At this sudden command a young mulatto,
hesitating, came through a break in the hedge
and stood looking at him, sullen and silent. In
his hands he carried a small bundle done up in
a colored handkerchief and on this guilty piece
of baggage Uncle Billy's eye immediately
fastened with an angry frown.</p>

<p>&quot;Whar you gwine?&quot; demanded Uncle Billy,
with an accusing finger trembling at the
bundle.</p>

<p>The younger man made no reply.</p>

<p>&quot;Hear <i>me</i>?&quot; the elder demanded again in
rising tones of severity. &quot;Ain't you got no
tongue in yo' haid? Whar you gwine?&quot;</p>

<p>Shifting from one foot to the other the
younger man finally broke away from Uncle
Billy's eye and tried to pass him by.</p>

<p>&quot;Den <i>I'll</i> tell you whar you gwine,&quot; shouted
Uncle Billy, furious at last. &quot;You's runnin'
'way to de Yankees, dat's whar you gwine.&quot;</p>

<p>At this too truthful thrust Jeems Henry
saw that further deceit would be futile and
he faced Uncle Billy with sullen resentment.</p>

<p>&quot;An' s'posin' I <i>is</i>&mdash;wat den?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Den you's a thief,&quot; retorted Uncle Billy
with dismayingly quick wit. &quot;Dat's what you
is&mdash;a <i>thief</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I <i>ain'</i> no thief,&quot; Jeems Henry refuted
stubbornly, &quot;<i>I</i> ain' stole nothin'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You is too,&quot; and Uncle Billy's forefinger
began to shake in the other's face. &quot;You's
stealin' a <i>nigger</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What dat?&quot; and Jeems Henry's eyes
opened wide with amazement. &quot;What you
talkin' 'bout?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Talkin' 'bout <i>you</i>,&quot; replied Uncle Billy,
sharper than ever. &quot;Dey say a nigger's wuth
a thousan' dollars. 'Cose <i>you</i> ain't wuth dat
much,&quot; he said with utter disgust. &quot;I put you
down at a dollar and a quarter. But dat ain't
de p'int,&quot; and he steadily advanced on the other
till their faces were only a few inches apart.
&quot;It's dis. <i>You</i>, Jeems Henry, belongs to
Mars' Herbert Cary an' Miss Hallie; an' when
you runs 'way you's stealin'. <i>You's stealin
yo'sef!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm!&quot; sniffed Jeems Henry, now that the
nature and extent of his crime were fully understood.
&quot;Ef I ain' wuth but a dollar an' a
quarter, I suttenly ain' stealin' <i>much</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>At this smart reply Uncle Billy's disgust
overcame him completely and he tossed the
rooster on the ground and clutched Jeems
Henry by the arm.</p>

<p>&quot;You mighty right, you ain't!&quot; he shouted.
&quot;An' ef I was fo' years younger I'd take it
outer yo' hide with a carriage whip. Hol' on
dar,&quot; as Jeems Henry eluded his grasp and
began to move away. &quot;Which way you
gwine? You hear me? Now den!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I gwine up de river,&quot; replied Jeems Henry,
badgered at last into revealing his plan.
Then, after a cautious look around,&mdash;&quot;to
Chickahominy Swamp,&quot; he added in lower
tones.</p>

<p>Uncle Billy cocked his ears. Here was
news indeed.</p>

<p>&quot;Chickahominy, huh! So de Yankees is up
dar, is dey? An' what you think you gwine
to do when you git to 'em?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wuck 'roun de camp,&quot; replied Jeems
Henry with some vagueness.</p>

<p>&quot;Doin' what?&quot; was the relentless query.</p>

<p>&quot;Blackin' de gent'men's boots&mdash;an'&mdash;an'
gittin' paid fer it,&quot; Jeems Henry stammered
in reply. &quot;It's better'n being a slave, Unc'
Billy,&quot; he added as he saw the sneer of contempt
on the faithful old man's face. &quot;An'
ef you wan' sech a crazy ol' fool, you'd come
along wid me, too.&quot;</p>

<p>At this combination of temptation and insult
Uncle Billy's eyes narrowed with contempt
and loathing. &quot;Me?&quot; he said, and a
rigid arm pointed back at the house which had
been for years his source of shelter and comfort.
&quot;Me leave Miss Hallie <i>now</i>? Right
when she ain't got <i>nothin</i>'? Look heah, nigger;
dog-gone yo' skin, I got a great min' for to
mash yo' mouf. Yas, I <i>is</i> a slave. I b'longs
to Mars Cary&mdash;an' I b'longed to his pa befo'
him. Dey feed me and gimme de bes' dey
got. Dey take care of me when I'm sick&mdash;an'
dey take care of me when I'm well&mdash;an' <i>I</i>
gwine to stay right here. But you? You jes'
go on wid de Yankees, an' black der boots.
Dey'll free you,&quot; and Uncle Billy's voice rose
in prophetic tones&mdash;&quot;an you'll <i>keep on</i> blackin'
boots! Go 'long now, you low-down, dollar-an'-a-quarter
nigger!&quot; as Jeems Henry backed
away. &quot;Go long wid yo' <i>Yankee</i> marsters&mdash;and
git yo' freedom an' a blackin' brush.&quot;</p>

<p>So engrossed were both the actors in this
drama that they failed to hear the sound of
footsteps on the veranda, and it was so that
the mistress of the manor found the would-be
runaway and the old slave, glaring into each
other's eyes and insulting one another volubly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary, with her workbasket on her arm,
paused at the top of the steps and regarded
the angry pair with well-bred surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Uncle Billy,&quot; she queried, &quot;what is
going on here? What <i>is</i> the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Jeems Henry; dat's what's de matter,&quot;
said Uncle Billy, in defense of his agitation.
&quot;He's runnin' 'way to de Yankees.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary stopped short for a moment and
then came slowly down the steps.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, James,&quot; she said, unbelievingly. &quot;Is
this really true?&quot;</p>

<p>Jeems Henry hung his head and dug at the
gravel with his toe.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; said Mrs. Cary, and the word
held a world of painful thought&mdash;of self-accusation,
of hopeless regret, of sorrow for one
who could be so foolishly misguided. &quot;I'm
sorry not only for ourselves but for <i>you</i>. You
know, I promised Mammy before she died that
I would look after you&mdash;always.&quot;</p>

<p>Still Jeems Henry made no answer and old
Uncle Billy saw fit to make a disclosure.</p>

<p>&quot;He's gwine up to Chickahominy.&quot; Then
to Jeems Henry he added something in low
tones which made the young negro's eyes roll
wildly with fear. &quot;Dey tells me dat der's
<i>hants</i> and <i>ghoses</i> over dar. I hopes dey'll git
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop that!&quot; commanded Mrs. Cary. &quot;You
know very well, Uncle Billy, there are no such
things as ghosts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor'm I don't, Miss Hallie,&quot; responded
Uncle Billy, sticking tenaciously to his point,
because he could plainly see Jeems Henry
wavering. &quot;'Twas jes las' night I hear one&mdash;moanin'
'roun' de smoke house. An' ef I ain't
mighty fur wrong, she was smellin' arfter
Jeems Henry.&quot;</p>

<p>At this wild fabrication, the reason for
which she nevertheless appreciated, Mrs. Cary
had hard work to hold back a smile, although
she promptly reassured the terrified Jeems
Henry.</p>

<p>&quot;There now&mdash;there&mdash;that will do. Nothing
of that kind will trouble you, James; you may
take my word for it. If you are quite determined
to go I shall not try to keep you. But
what have you in that bundle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hi! Hi! Dat's de way to talk!&quot; interrupted
Uncle Billy, excitedly foreseeing
means to prevent Jeems Henry's departure.
&quot;What you got in yo' bundle?&quot;</p>

<p>Jeems Henry lifted his anguished eyes and
gazed truthfully at his mistress.</p>

<p>&quot;I ain't got nothin'&mdash;what don't b'long to
me, Miss Hallie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't mean that,&quot; Mrs. Cary responded
kindly. &quot;But you have a long tramp before
you. Have you anything to eat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor'm, I ain't,&quot; and Jeems Henry seemed
disturbed.</p>

<p>&quot;Then you'd better come around to the
kitchen. We'll see what we can find.&quot;</p>

<p>At this unheard-of generosity, Uncle Billy's
eyes opened widely and he exploded in remonstrance.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, hol' on dar, Miss Hallie! Hol' on.
You ain' got none too much fo' yo'se'f, d'out
stuffin' dis yere six-bit rat hole wid waffles an'
milasses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>William!</i>&quot; commanded his mistress.</p>

<p>&quot;Yas'm,&quot; was the meek response, and Uncle
Billy subsided into silence.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Mrs. Cary turned away toward
the house. &quot;Well, James, are you coming?&quot;</p>

<p>But Jeems Henry, completely abashed before
this miracle of kindness which he did not
deserve, decided that it was time for him to be
a man.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Miss Hallie,&quot; he gulped, &quot;but
f'um now on I reckon I gwine take keer of
myse'f.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary, pausing on the bottom step,
raised her eyes heavenward in a short prayer
that children such as these might somehow be
protected from themselves.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, James,&quot; she said, when she saw there
was nothing more to be done. &quot;I hope you'll
be happy and contented. If you are not&mdash;come
back to us. Perhaps, when the war is
over, you'll find things a little more&mdash;comfortable.
Good-by, James,&quot; and she held out her
hand.</p>

<p>But this last touch of gentleness was too
much for the young mulatto. Although he
made an obedient step forward, his feelings
overcame him and with an audible snuffle and
his hand over his eyes he retreated&mdash;then
turned his back and plunged through the
hedge.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary sank down on the step and looked
as if she, too, would like to cry.</p>

<p>Manfully, Uncle Billy came to her rescue.
&quot;Now don't you care, Miss Hallie. He wan'
no 'count for plowin' no how.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it isn't that, Uncle Billy,&quot; Mrs. Cary
replied with a low cry of regret. &quot;It isn't the
actual loss of help, tho' we need it, goodness
knows. But it makes me sad to see them leaving,
one by one. They are such children and
so helpless&mdash;without a master hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yas'm,&quot; agreed Uncle Billy readily. &quot;An'
de marster's han' ought to have a hick'ry stick
in it fer <i>dat</i> nigger. Yas, bless Gawd. But
you got <i>me</i>, Miss Hallie,&quot; he announced
proudly. &quot;<i>I</i> ain't runned away to de blue-bellies
yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you dear old thing,&quot; Mrs. Cary cried
with laughing relief, and her hand rested on
his shoulder in a gentle caress. &quot;I'd as soon
think of the skies falling. It is just such faithful
friends as you who help me to fight the
best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um?&quot; said Uncle Billy promptly, not quite
understanding.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean a woman's battles, Uncle Billy&mdash;the
<i>waiting</i> battles&mdash;that we fight alone.&quot;
Mrs. Gary rose to her feet and turned sadly
away.</p>

<p>&quot;Yas'm,&quot; agreed Uncle Billy. &quot;I dunno
what yo' talkin' 'bout but I spec' you's right.
Yas'm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Uncle Billy,&quot; repeated Mrs. Gary,
while her eyes filled with tears. &quot;The most
truthful&mdash;the most <i>honest</i>&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary stopped and looked sharply at
something lying on the ground beside the
steps. Then she turned and swept the old
man with an accusing glance which made him
quail.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>William!</i>&quot; she said, in awful tones.</p>

<p>&quot;Yas'm,&quot; replied Uncle Billy, feverishly.</p>

<p>&quot;What's <i>that</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Billy immediately became the very
picture of innocence and ignorance. He
looked everywhere but at the helpless rooster.</p>

<p>&quot;What's what?&quot; he asked. &quot;Aw, dat?
Why&mdash;why, dat ain' nothin' 'tall, Miss Hallie.
Dat's&mdash;dat's des a <i>rooster</i>. Yas'm.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary came down from the steps and
looked carefully at the unfamiliar bird. No
fear that she would not recognize it if it were
hers. &quot;Whose is he?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;You&mdash;you mean who he b'longs to?&quot; queried
Uncle Billy, fencing for time in which to
prepare a quasi-truthful reply. &quot;He&mdash;he
don' b'long to <i>nobody</i>. He's his <i>own</i> rooster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;William!&quot; commanded Mrs. Cary, severely.
&quot;Look at me. <i>Where</i> did you get
him?&quot;</p>

<p>Here was a situation which Uncle Billy
knew must be handled promptly, and he picked
up the rooster and made an attempt to escape.
&quot;Down on de low grouns&mdash;dis mornin'. Dat's
right,&quot; he said, as he saw dawning unbelief in
his mistress' face. &quot;Now you have to skuse
me, Miss Hallie. I got my wuck to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One moment, William,&quot; interposed Mrs.
Cary, completely unconvinced. &quot;You are
sure he was on the low grounds?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cose I is!&quot; asseverated Uncle Billy, meanwhile
backing farther away.</p>

<p>&quot;What was he doing there?&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Billy stammered.</p>

<p>&quot;He&mdash;he&mdash;he, he was trespassin', dat's what
he was doin'&mdash;des natcherly trespassin'.&quot;</p>

<p>At this marvel of testimony, Mrs. Cary's
lips relaxed in a smile and she warned him
with an upraised finger.</p>

<p>&quot;Be careful, Uncle Billy! Be careful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yas, <i>mar'm</i>&quot; chuckled the old man. &quot;I
<i>had</i> to be. I never would a-got him! Oh,
I's tellin' de trufe, Miss Hallie. Dis' here ol'
sinner tooken flewed off a boat what was
comin' up de river. Yas'm. And he sure
was old enough to know better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you <i>saw</i> him fly off the boat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yas'm. I seed him. I seed him,&quot; and
Uncle Billy floundered for a moment, caught
in his own trap. &quot;Dat is, not wid my own
eyes. But I see him settin' in de woods,
lookin' dat lonesome and losted like, I felt real
sorry for him. Yas'm,&quot; and to prove his deep
sympathy for the unfortunate bird he stroked
its breast lovingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary turned away to hide her laughter.
&quot;How did you catch him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot; repeated Uncle Billy, while his ancient
mind worked with unusual rapidity. &quot;I
got down on all fo's in the thick weeds, an'
cluk like a hen. An' den ol' Mr. Rooster, he
came 'long over to see ef I done laid an aig&mdash;an'
I des reach right out an' take him home to
de Lawd.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Uncle Billy,&quot; his mistress laughed.
&quot;I'm afraid you're incorrigible. It's a dreadful
thing to doubt one's very dinner. Isn't
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yas'm. An' I was des 'bout to say ef you
an' Miss Virgie kin worry down de white meat,
maybe den dis here bird 'll kinder git eben wid
me when I tackle his drum sticks. Yas'm,&quot;
and with a final chuckle of joy over his success
the old man hobbled quickly away in the direction
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary, still smiling, went back to play
Mrs. Fatima to a dusky moss-covered Blue
Beard.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh goody, goody, here is Mrs. Fatima
again!&quot; and Virgie's dancing feet seemed
hardly to touch the ground. &quot;We've just
finished building the castle. Look!&quot; She
pointed proudly to a square of twigs and leaves
around the garden seat. &quot;Come on, Sally
Ann. We can play it now and use Mamma's
keys.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait dar! Whar'd I put my s'wode?&quot;
And Sally Ann snatched up her dangerous
weapon and thrust it into a rope around her
waist. &quot;Now I'se ready fo' killin' folks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we have to begin where Blue Beard
goes away on a journey,&quot; Virgie cried. &quot;Susan
Jemima, you sit there on the bench and clap
your hands. Get up, Mamma. Go ahead,
Sally Ann!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Ooman,&quot; said Sally Ann, strutting up to
her mistress and frowning terribly. &quot;I'se
gwine away fer a night an' a day. Dese yere
is de keys to de castle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; was the meek response.</p>

<p>Sally Ann Blue Beard pointed to an imaginary
door halfway between them and where
Virgie sat on the steps, wriggling with delight.
&quot;You kin look in ev'ry room in de house&mdash;castle,
I means&mdash;'cept in des dat one.
Orn'estan me? <i>Des dat one!</i> But ef yo'
looks in <i>dar</i>,&mdash;Gawd he'p you. I gwine cut
yo' haid off,&quot; and the fearful sword whizzed
threateningly through the air. &quot;Fyarwell&mdash;fyarwell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Farewell, my lord,&quot; said Mrs. Cary, and
then in a whisper, as Blue Beard stalked away
to hide behind a tree. &quot;What <i>do</i> we do now?
<i>Quick</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now I come in,&quot; cried Virgie. &quot;I'm
'Sister Anne' that looks for the horseman in
the cloud of dust.&quot; And jumping up, the
child managed to change the tones of her voice
in a surprising manner.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, fair sister. Blue Beard
has gone away, and now we can look in his
secret room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Sister Anne, No! I dare not,&quot; and
Mrs. Fatima shrank back full of fear from the
imaginary door. &quot;Urge me no more. I am
afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Mother,&quot; cried Virgie, with a little
squeal of disappointment. &quot;You <i>have</i> to.
It's part of the play,&quot; and she led her up to
the invisible door.</p>

<p>&quot;Now look in&mdash;and when you look&mdash;drop
the keys&mdash;an' we'll both scream.&quot;</p>

<p>Slowly the door seemed to open and, after
an instant's terrified silence, both actresses
screamed with complete success. Whereupon
Mrs. Fatima dropped to her knees and Sister
Anne hugged her tight.</p>

<p>&quot;It's blood. It's the blood of his seven
wives. O-o-o-e-e-e!&quot;</p>

<p>A great roar sounded in their ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Mercy! What's that?&quot; cried the terrified
Mrs. Fatima.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Blue Beard. He's coming back,&quot;
whereupon Virgie immediately left Mrs. Fatima
to face her fate alone.</p>

<p>Having spent a night and a day behind the
tree, Blue Beard now rushed upon the castle
and roared for his wife.</p>

<p>&quot;Greeting, my lord,&quot; said the trembling
Mrs. Fatima with a low curtsey &quot;I hope
you have enjoyed your journey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Ooman,&quot; demanded Blue Beard severely.
&quot;What make you look so pale?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know not, sweet sir. Am I, then, so
pale?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You is! What you be'n up to sence I be'n
away? Ha! What I tole you? Look at
de blood on dat key! False 'ooman, you done
deceib' me. Down on yo' marrow bones an'
prepyar to die!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spare me, my lord. Spare me! I am
so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>It was just about this time that old Uncle
Billy, with a bridle in one hand and a carriage
whip in the other came slowly upon the scene.
At the sight of Sally Ann apparently about
to assault his mistress the bridle dropped from
his hand and with a tight clutch on the carriage
whip he covered the intervening space
at an amazing speed.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi, dar! You li'l woolly haided imp!
You tech Miss Hallie wid dat ar stick an' I
bus' you wide open!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, stop, Uncle Billy!&quot; cried Virgie in dismay.
&quot;We're only having a play!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe you is; but I lay ef I wrop my carriage
whip roun' her laig, des oncet, she'll hop
all de way to de river.&quot;</p>

<p>At this dismal prospect, which seemed much
truer than the play, Sally Ann began to
whimper loudly. &quot;Miss Hallie, ef he stay
here, I ain't gwine to play.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whar you git dem whiskers at?&quot; demanded
Uncle Billy.</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up!&quot; cried Virgie.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm shuttin',&quot; said Uncle Billy, retreating.</p>

<p>Thus reassured Sally Ann continued:</p>

<p>&quot;I gwine down stairs to git my dinner
When I come back, I sho' gwine kill you.
Fyar you well,&quot; and Blue Beard, making a
wide circle around the carriage whip, took
himself off the scene.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Mother,&quot; Virgie announced, &quot;I
have to watch at the castle window,&quot; and she
jumped up on the bench.</p>

<p>&quot;Sister Anne; Sister Anne, do you see anybody
coming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one, Fatima&mdash;nothing but a cloud of
dust made by the wind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look again, Sister Anne. Do you see
anybody coming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Fatima, Fatima. It's growing
bigger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dar now,&quot; interposed Uncle Billy. &quot;She's
seem' som'pin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sister Anne! Sister Anne. And what do;
you see?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dust! Dust! I see a horseman in a cloud
of dust. Look! Look! He's coming this
way.&quot; By this time Virgie's acting had taken
on so close a resemblance to the real thing that
both Mrs. Gary and Uncle Billy rose to their
feet in wonder.</p>

<p>&quot;He's jumped the <i>fence</i>,&quot; cried Virgie.
&quot;He's cutting across our fields! He sees me!
He's waving his hat to me!&quot; With the last
words the child suddenly jumped down from
the bench and ran through the opening in the
hedge, leaving her mother gazing after her in
sudden consternation.</p>

<p>&quot;Name we Gawd! Miss Hallie,&quot; gasped
Uncle Billy. &quot;You reckon she done brought
somebody, sho' 'nuff? Hi! Hi! <i>I</i> hear sum'-pin.
It's a horse. Lan' er Glory! Hits,
<i>him</i>!&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>Round the corner of the hedge at a swift
trot came a man in the uniform of an officer
in the Confederate Army,&mdash;and Virgie was in
his arms.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary gave him one look and threw out
her arms.</p>

<p>&quot;Herbert!&quot;</p>

<p>The man on horseback let Virgie slide down
and then dismounted like a flash, coming to
her across the little space of lawn with his
whole soul in his eyes. With his dear wife
caught in his arms he could do nothing but
kiss her and hold her as if he would never again
let her go.</p>

<p>&quot;Hallie,&quot; he breathed, &quot;but it's good to see
you again. It's <i>good</i>.&quot; And so they stood
for a long moment, husband and wife united
after months of separation, after dangers and
terrors and privations which had seemed as
if they never would end.</p>

<p>Sally Ann was one of the first to interrupt,
edging up at the earliest opportunity with her
beard in her hand. &quot;How you does, Mars'
Cary? How you fine yo'sef, seh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, hullo, Sally Ann!&quot; said Cary, and
put out his hand. &quot;What on earth is this
thing?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie ran to his side and caught his hand
in hers. &quot;We were playing 'Blue Beard,'
Daddy,&mdash;an' you came just like the brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you've been Blue Beard, have you,
Sally Ann?&mdash;then I must have the pleasure
of cutting you into ribbons.&quot; Herbert Cary's
shining saber flashed half out of its scabbard
and then, laughing, he slapped it back with a
clank.</p>

<p>&quot;Sally Ann,&quot; he announced, &quot;I'm going to
turn you into Sister Anne for a while. You
run up to Miss Hallie's room and sit by the
window where you can watch the road and
woods. If you see anything&mdash;soldiers, I
mean&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Herbert!&quot; cried his wife in anguish.</p>

<p>&quot;S-s-sh!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Go along, Sally
Ann. If you see anyone at all report to me
at once. Understand? Off with you!&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Billy now came forward in an effort
to make his master's clothes more presentable.</p>

<p>&quot;Heh, Mars' Cary, lemme brush you off,
seh. You's fyar kivered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look out, you old rascal,&quot; Cary laughed,
as his wife backed away coughing before the
cloud of fine white dust that rose under Uncle
Billy's vigorous hands. &quot;You're choking
your mistress to death. Never mind the dust.
I'll get it back in ten minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary clasped her hands together at
her breast with a look of entreaty.</p>

<p>&quot;Herbert! Must you go so soon?&quot;</p>

<p>Her husband looked back at her with eyes
dark with regret.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said briefly. &quot;I'm on my way to
Richmond. How many horses are there in
the stable?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two&mdash;only two,&quot; was the broken response,
as his wife sank down disconsolate on a bench.
&quot;Belle and Lightfoot&mdash;we sold the others&mdash;I
<i>had</i> to do it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know, little woman. It couldn't
be helped. Here, Billy! Take my horse and
get Belle out of the stable. Lead them down
to the swamp and hide them in the cedars.
Then saddle Lightfoot&mdash;bring him here and
give him some water and a measure of corn.
Look sharp, Billy! Lively!&quot;</p>

<p>In the face of danger to his master Uncle
Billy's response was instant. &quot;Yes, seh.
Right away, seh,&quot; and he took Cary's lathered
animal and made off for the stables at top
speed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary looked up at her husband with a
great fear written on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Herbert dear. You&mdash;you don't
mean to say that the Yankees are in the neighborhood?&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately Cary was on the bench beside
her with his arm around her, while Virgie
climbed up on the other side.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, come,&quot; he murmured, &quot;be a brave
little woman and don't be alarmed. It may
be nothing after all. Only&mdash;there are several
foraging parties&mdash;small ones, a few miles
down the river. I've been dodging them all
morning. If they come at all they won't
trouble either you or Virgie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But <i>I'm</i> not afraid of them, Daddy-man,&quot;
cried the small daughter, and she doubled up
her fist ferociously. &quot;Look at <i>that</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aha! There's a brave little Rebel,&quot; her
father cried as he swept her up in a hearty hug.
&quot;<i>You're</i> not afraid of them,&mdash;nor you either,
God bless you,&quot; and his lips rested for a moment
on his wife's soft cheek. &quot;Only, you are
apt to be a little too haughty. If they search
the house for arms or stragglers, make no resistance.
It's best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I know,&quot; his wife cried out, &quot;but
you, dear, <i>you</i>! Why are you here? Why
aren't you with your company?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary looked away for a moment across the
fields and down the slope towards the shimmering
river. They were very beautiful&mdash;he
wondered why he had not fully realized
all that wife and child and home meant to him
when he volunteered recently for a certain
hazardous duty. He knew, too, how quickly
his dear wife would know the full extent of
the peril with which he felt himself surrounded.
And so his reply was short and
seemingly gruff, as many another man's has
been under too heavy circumstances.</p>

<p>&quot;Scouting duty. I've been on it for the
past two months.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary's hand went to her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;A <i>scout</i>, Herbert! But, darling, why?
It's so dangerous&mdash;so horrible&mdash;so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He put up his hand, with a forced smile, to
check her, and broke in gayly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, but think of the fun in it. It's like
playing hide-and-go-seek with Virgie.&quot;</p>

<p>But his wife was not to be put off so lightly
and she put her impelling hands on his arm.</p>

<p>Gary changed his tone. His voice deepened.</p>

<p>&quot;They need me, dear,&quot; he said earnestly.
&quot;What does danger to one man mean when
Dixie calls us all? And I'm doing work&mdash;good
work. I've already given one battle to
General Lee and now I have information that
will give him another and a bigger one. Two
nights ago I came through the Union lines.
I ...&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary rose unsteadily to her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Through the Yankee lines! Oh, Herbert.
<i>Not as a spy!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A spy? Of course not. I hid in the
woods all day, then climbed a tall pine tree
and got the lay of their camp&mdash;the number of
their guns&mdash;the disposition of forces and their
lines of attack. Yesterday I had the wires at
Drury's Bluff and started trouble. I'm on my
way now to join my command, but I had a
good excuse for coming home to hold you in
in my arms again, if only for a moment. You
see, poor old Roger got a wound in his flank&mdash;from
a stray bullet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A <i>stray</i> bullet,&quot; asked Mrs. Gary, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he smiled, for he had escaped it, &quot;a
stray bullet meant for <i>me</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Daddy,&quot; Virgie interrupted, &quot;while
you were up in the tree&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>A wild whoop broke off Virgie's question.
Sally Ann was rushing down the steps, her
eyes rolling up with excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;Mars' Cary! Mars' Cary! Somebody
comin' long de road!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who? How many?&quot; Cary demanded,
springing up and running towards the gate
that opened on the wagon road over the
hills.</p>

<p>&quot;Des' one,&quot; responded Sally Ann with
na&iuml;ve truthfulness. &quot;Ol' Dr. Simmons. He
drivin' by de gate in de buggy.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary threw up her hands with a muffled
cry of relief and laughter. &quot;Oh, Sally!
Sally!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;you'll be the death
of me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Lor! Miss Hallie,&quot; said Sally plaintively,
&quot;he <i>tole</i> me fer to tell him.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary, returning, waved Sally Ann back to
her post. &quot;That's right,&quot; he laughed.
&quot;You're a good sentry, Sally Ann. Go back
and watch again. <i>Scoot</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Herbert,&quot; and his wife stood before him.
&quot;Come into the house and let me give you
something to eat.&quot;</p>

<p>For answer Cary gently imprisoned her
face in his hands. &quot;Honey, I can't,&quot; he said,
his eyes grown sad again. &quot;Just fix me up
something&mdash;anything you can find. I'll
munch it in the saddle.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment their lips clung and then she
stepped back with a broken sigh. &quot;I'll do the
best I can, but oh! how I wish it all were over
and that we had you home again.&quot;</p>

<p>A spasm crossed the man's face. &quot;It soon
<i>will</i> be over, sweetheart. It soon <i>will</i> be.&quot;</p>

<p>His wife flung him a startled look. &quot;You
mean&mdash;Oh, Herbert! Isn't there a single
hope&mdash;even the tiniest ray?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary took her hands in his, looked into her
eyes and his answer breathed the still unconquered
spirit of the South. &quot;There is always
hope&mdash;as long as we have a man.&quot; Mrs. Cary
went into the house, slowly, wearily, and Cary
turned to Virgie.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, little lady,&quot; her father said, resting
his hand on Virgie's shining head. &quot;Have
you been taking good care of mother&mdash;and
seeing that Uncle Billy does his plowing
right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; came the prompt response.
&quot;Susan Jemima an' me have been lookin'
after everything&mdash;but we had to eat up General
Butler!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;General Butler,&quot; cried her father, astounded.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Daddy&mdash;our lastest calf. We named
him that 'cause one day when I was feedin'
him with milk he nearly swallowed my silver
spoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha-ha,&quot; laughed the amused soldier, and
swept her up in his arms. &quot;If we could only
get rid of all their generals as easy as that
we'd promise not to eat again for a week.
Everything else all right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; said Virgie, dolefully. &quot;All the
niggers has runned away&mdash;all 'cept Uncle
Billy and Sally Ann. Jeems Henry runned
away this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The deuce he did! The young scamp!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's gone to join the Yankees,&quot; Virgie
continued.</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; and Cary sprang up to pace
to and fro. &quot;I wonder which way he went?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don' know,&quot; whimpered Virgie forlornly.
&quot;I only wish I was a soldier with a big, sharp
sword like yours&mdash;'cause when the blue boys
came I'd <i>stick</i> 'em in the stomach.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary was coming down the steps now
with a small package of food and in the roadway
Uncle Billy stood feeding and watering
his master's horse. In this bitterest of moments,
when his own family had to be the ones
to hurry him along his way, there had come
another and greater danger&mdash;peril to those he
loved.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me, dear,&quot; he said with his hand warm
on his wife's soft shoulder. &quot;Is it true that
Jeems Henry ran away this morning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she nodded. &quot;I knew the poor boy
meant to leave us sooner or later, so I made
no effort to detain him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did right,&quot; was the answer. &quot;But
which way did he go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Up the river. To a Union camp on the
Chickahominy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Chickahominy!&quot; exclaimed Cary sharply,
and bit his lips. &quot;So that's the lay of the land,
eh! I'm mighty glad you told me this. But
still&mdash;&quot; Cary's voice faded away under the
weight of a sudden despair. What was the
use of fighting forever against such fearful
odds? What could they ever gain&mdash;save a little
more honor&mdash;and at what dreadful cost?</p>

<p>&quot;What makes you look so worried, Herbert?&quot;
his wife murmured, her nerves on edge
again.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's true,&quot; the man said with a groan.
&quot;They're gradually closing in on us&mdash;surrounding
Richmond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Surrounding us?</i>&quot; Mrs. Cary whispered,
hardly believing her ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's true&mdash;all too true,&quot; the man
burst out bitterly. &quot;We can fight against
thousands&mdash;and against tens of thousands but,
darling, we can't fight half the world.&quot;</p>

<p>He sank down on the bench, one elbow on
his crossed knee, the other arm hanging listlessly
by his side. His face grew lined and
haggard. All the spirit, the indomitable
courage of a moment ago had fled before the
revelation that, try as they might, they could
never conquer in this terribly unequal fight.
Then he threw out his hand and began to
speak, half to her and half to the unseen armies
of his fellows.</p>

<p>&quot;Our armies are exhausted. Dwindling
day by day. We are drawing from the cradle
and the grave. Old men&mdash;who can scarcely
bear the weight of a musket on their shoulders:
and boys&mdash;mere children&mdash;who are sacrificed
under the blood-stained wheels. The
best! The flower of our land! We are
dumping them all into a big, red hopper.
Feed! Feed! Always more feed for this
greedy machine of war!&quot;</p>

<p>Silently wife and daughter came to the man
in his despair, as if to ward off some dark
shape which hovered over him with brushing
wings. Their arms went around him together.</p>

<p>&quot;There, there, dear,&quot; he heard a soft voice
whisper, &quot;don't grow despondent. <i>Think!</i>
Even though you've fought a losing fight it
has been a glorious one&mdash;and God will not
forget the Stars and Bars! Remember,&mdash;you
still have us&mdash;who love you to the end&mdash;and
fight your battles&mdash;on our knees.&quot;</p>

<p>Slowly the man looked up.</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive me, honey,&quot; he murmured remorsefully.
&quot;You are right&mdash;and bravest,
after all. It is you&mdash;you women, who save us
in the darkest hours. You&mdash;our wives&mdash;our
mothers&mdash;who wage a silent battle in the
lonely, broken homes. You give us love and
pity&mdash;tenderness and tears&mdash;a flag of pride
that turns defeat to victory. The women of
the South,&quot; he cried, and Herbert Cary
doffed his hat before his wife, &quot;the crutch
on which the staggering hope of Dixie leans!&quot;</p>

<p>There came, then, the sound of hurrying
footsteps. Once more Sally Ann rushed from
the house but this time genuine danger was
written plainly in her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Mars' Cary! Mars' Cary! Dey's comin'
dis time&mdash;sho' 'nuff!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How many?&quot; Cary cried, springing for the
roadway and his horse.</p>

<p>&quot;Dey's comin' thu' de woods&mdash;an' Lawd
Gawd, de yearth is fyar blue wid' 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Billy!&quot; commanded Cary. &quot;Take Lightfoot
as fast as you can down to the edge
of the woods. Don't worry, Hallie, they'll
never catch me once I'm in the saddle.&quot;</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her, then caught up
Virgie for a last hug, burying his worn face
in her curls. &quot;Good-by, little one. Take
good care of Mother. Good-by!&quot;</p>

<p>With one last grasp his wife caught his
hand. &quot;Herbert! which way do you go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Across the river&mdash;to the Chesterfield side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the Yankees came that way, too!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll circle around them. If they've left a
guard at the crossing I'll swim the river
higher up.&quot; He slapped his holster with his
open hand. &quot;Listen for three shots. If they
come in quick succession&mdash;then I've crossed&mdash;I'm
safe. If I only had a few men I'd stay,
but alone, I can't&mdash;you know I can't. Good-by!
God bless you.&quot; And in another moment
he was in the saddle&mdash;had waved his
hand&mdash;was gone.</p>

<p>Straining their eyes after him, as if they
would somehow pierce the dark woods which
hid his flight, mother and daughter stood as
if turned to stone. Only Virgie, after a moment,
waved her hand and sent her soft,
childish prayer winging after him to save him
from all harm. &quot;Good-by, Daddy-man,
good-by!&quot;</p>

<p>Sally Ann, however, having seen the approaching
danger with her own eyes, began
to wring her hands and cry hysterically.
&quot;Aw, Miss Hallie, I so skeered! I so
skeered!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sally,&quot; cried Mrs. Cary, as the sound of
hoofbeats thudding through the woods came
unmistakably to her ears, &quot;take Virgie with
you instantly and run down through the grove
to the old ice house. Hide there under the
pine tags. Understand?&quot;</p>

<p>But the negro girl, ashen with terror,
seemed incapable of flight.</p>

<p>&quot;I skeered to go, Miss Hallie,&quot; she whimpered.
&quot;I wan' stay here wid you! Ou-ou!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you can't, I tell you,&quot; her mistress answered,
as the certainty of the girl's helplessness
before a questioner flashed through her
mind. &quot;You'd tell everything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, come on, you big baby,&quot; Virgie urged,
pulling at Sally Arm's sleeve. &quot;<i>I'll</i> take
care of you.&quot; Then her eye fell on Susan
Jemima lying neglected on the bench and she
gave a faint scream at her heartlessness.
&quot;Goodness gracious, Mother,&quot; she cried, as,
still holding on to Sally Ann, she ran and
caught up her beloved doll. &quot;I nearly forgot
my child!&quot;</p>

<p>With the clank of sabers and the sound of
gruff commands already in her ears, Mrs.
Cary turned peremptorily to Uncle Billy.</p>

<p>&quot;Remember, William! If the Yankees
ask for my husband <i>you haven't seen him!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor'm, dat's right,&quot; was the prompt
answer. &quot;I dunno you eben got one. But
you go in de house, Miss Hallie. Dat's de
bes' way,&mdash;yas'm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps it <i>is</i> best,&quot; his mistress answered.
&quot;The longer we can detain them the better for
Captain Cary. You'd better come in yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yas'm,&quot; replied the faithful old man, although
such action was farthest from his
thoughts. &quot;In des' a minnit. I'll be dar in
des' a minnit.&quot;</p>

<p>But once his mistress had closed the door
behind her Uncle Billy's plan of operations
changed. Hurrying down the steps he
plunged his arm under the porch and drew
forth&mdash;a rusty ax. With his weapon over
his shoulder he hastened up on the veranda and
stood with his back against the door.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>The thudding feet came nearer. A bugle
call&mdash;a rattling of accouterments and then,
from the other side of the hedge, came a half
dozen troopers in blue, led by a Sergeant with
a red face and bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;This way, boys!&quot; the Sergeant shouted, and
at the sound of a harsh, never-forgotten voice
Uncle Billy's grasp on his ax grew tighter.
&quot;<i>I</i> know the place&mdash;I've been here before.
<i>We'll</i> get the liquor and silver while the Colonel
is stealing the horses, eh?&quot; Then his eyes
fell on Uncle Billy and he greeted him with
a yell of recognition. &quot;Hello, you black old
ape! Come down and show us where you
buried the silver and the whisky. Oh, you
won't? Then I'll come up and get you,&quot; and
he lurched forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, white man,&quot; Uncle Billy
shouted, lifting the rusty ax high in the
air, &quot;you stay whar you is. Ef you come up
dem steps I'll split yo' ugly haid! I know
you, Jim Dudley,&quot; he cried. &quot;Mars' Cary
done give you <i>one</i> horse whippin', an' ef you
hang aroun' here you'll get anudder one!&quot;</p>

<p>Furious at the recollection of his shame of
a few years back when he had been overseer
on this same plantation, the Sergeant rushed
up the steps and knocked the ax aside with
his gun barrel. &quot;Yes, he did whip me, burn
him, and now I'll do the same for you.&quot;
Seizing Uncle Billy by the throat he pushed
him against the house.</p>

<p>Instantly the door swung open. Mrs.
Cary, her head held high, her beautiful dark
eyes blazing with wrath, stood on the
threshold.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop it!&quot; she commanded in tones that
brooked no disobedience even from a drunkard.
&quot;Let my servant go&mdash;instantly!&quot;</p>

<p>Astounded at this sudden apparition the
man shrank back for a moment, but almost
as quickly regained his bluster.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah-hah, the beautiful Mrs. Cary, eh! I'm
glad to see you looking so well&mdash;and handsome.&quot;</p>

<p>The words might as well have been spoken
to the wind for all the notice that the woman
paid them. With only a gesture of mingled
contempt and loathing she stepped to the railing
and called to the grinning troopers below.
&quot;Who is in command here?&quot;</p>

<p>To her horror only Dudley answered.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>I</i> am,&quot; he said, triumphantly. He thrust
a menacing face close to hers and ordered her
curtly. &quot;And I'd just as soon have <i>you</i> get
me a drink as the nigger. Come on, fine
lady.&quot;</p>

<p>Intent on insulting this woman whose husband
had once cut his back with a whip the man
caught her by the arm and roughly tried to
pull her to him. But before he could accomplish
his purpose retribution fell on him with
a heavy hand.</p>

<p>Through a gap in the hedge an officer at
the head of a dozen troopers appeared. One
look at the scene on the veranda and Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrison, with a smothered
cry, dashed up the steps.</p>

<p>&quot;You beastly coward,&quot; and catching the
drunkard by the collar he twisted him around
and hurled him thudding and bumping down
the steps. &quot;Dudley, I ought to have you
shot.&quot; He swept his arm out and gave voice
to a ringing command. &quot;Report to Lieutenant
Harris&mdash;at once&mdash;<i>under arrest!</i> Corporal!
Take his gun.&quot; He paused a moment
as a brother of the man now under arrest
stepped forward with a sullen face and
obeyed orders. Running his glance over the
line of faces, now suddenly vacant of expression,
he whipped them mercilessly with his
eye. &quot;You men, too, will hear from me. Go
to the stable and wait. Another piece of
work like this and I'll have your coats cut off
with a belt buckle! Clear out!&quot;</p>

<p>Then he turned to the beautiful woman in
white who stood only a few feet away, no
longer timid but in entire possession of her
faculties before what, she knew, might prove
a greater danger than a drunkard.</p>

<p>&quot;Madam,&quot; said the Union officer as he
doffed his hat, &quot;I couldn't apologize for this,
no matter how hard I tried; but, believe me,
I regret it&mdash;deeply.&quot;</p>

<p>In answer she slowly raised her heavy lidded
eyes and gave him her first thrust&mdash;smoothly
and deftly.</p>

<p>&quot;No apology is demanded,&quot; she murmured
in soft tones. &quot;I was merely unfamiliar with
the Union's method of attack.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Attack!&quot; he repeated, astounded, and
stepped back.</p>

<p>&quot;What else?&quot; she asked, simply. &quot;My
home is over-run; my servant assaulted&mdash;by a
drunken ruffian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The man will be punished,&quot; was the stern
reply, &quot;to the limit of my authority.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He <i>should</i> be. We know him,&quot; the Southern
woman said bitterly. &quot;Before the war he
was our overseer. He was cruel to the negroes
and my husband gave him a taste of his
own discipline&mdash;with a riding whip!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; Morrison nodded. &quot;But it is
not always in an officer's power to control each
individual in the service&mdash;especially at such a
time. Yet I assure you on the part of the
Union&mdash;and mine&mdash;that there was no intention
of attack.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary had chosen this moment in which
to draw her visitor off the veranda and when
she had successfully brought him to the foot
of the steps she looked up in smiling sarcasm
with another thrust.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Then since your visit would seem a
<i>social</i> one&mdash;how may I serve you, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison laughed lightly. This pretty cat
could scratch.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid, dear madam, you are wrong
again. My detachment is on foraging duty.
It is not a pleasant task&mdash;but our army is in
need of horses and supplies, and by the rules
of war, I must take what I can find.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even by force?&quot; came the quiet inquiry.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, even force,&quot; he answered, reddening.
&quot;With its proper limitations. I rob you, it is
true, but by virtue of necessity. In return I
can only offer, as I would to every other
woman of the South, all courtesy and protection
at my command,&quot; and Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrison, for the second time, took off his hat.</p>

<p>The Southern woman swept him a curtsey
filled with graceful mockery.</p>

<p>&quot;I thank you. There is consolation&mdash;and
even flattery&mdash;in being plundered by a gentleman.&quot;
She made a short gesture which
took in house, plantation and all the Cary
possessions. &quot;I regret sincerely that we
have nothing left; yet I beg you&mdash;help yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Morrison bit his lip, half in vexation
and half in amusement. &quot;At least you
make my undertaking a difficult one, although
I must admit, I hardly blame you.&quot; And
then, with a quick, searching look, &quot;Are there
any rebels hidden in your house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;No wounded officers&mdash;or refugees of any
kind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You give me your word for this&mdash;your
oath?&quot;</p>

<p>The Southern woman's head went up and
her eyes flashed. &quot;I do,&quot; she said contemptuously
and moved away.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; was the grave reply, and he
turned to dismiss his men. Then a thought
struck him and he detained her with a gesture.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, but if it <i>was</i> true&mdash;if a brother
or a father&mdash;was concealed in there&mdash;wouldn't
your answer be the same?&quot;</p>

<p>The answer that came proudly back did not
amaze him. &quot;I would try to protect them&mdash;yes!
Even with a <i>perjury</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he said sharply. &quot;Then, don't you
you see, you tie the hands of courtesy and
<i>force</i> me to&mdash;to this invasion of your home.
<i>Corporal!</i> Make a search of the house for
hidden arms or stragglers and report to me.
If any rebels are found&mdash;bring them out.
Wait,&quot; he ordered, as the Corporal promptly
started forward, &quot;nothing else, <i>whatever</i>, must
be taken or molested.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One moment,&quot; commanded Mrs. Cary in
her turn and beckoned to Uncle Billy who
had been standing by in silence. &quot;William!
conduct these soldiers through my house&mdash;and
show them every courtesy. If the Colonel's
orders are not obeyed, report to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yas'm,&quot; grinned Uncle Billy, with an
opera bouffe salute. &quot;Ev'ry molestashun I'se
gwine report.&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison laughed outright. &quot;I'm sorry
you still have doubts of my honorable intentions.
May&mdash;may my soldiers go in now?
Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>He walked away a few steps, then turned
and looked at her where she sat on the bench
demurely sewing. It occurred to him that
she was <i>too</i> demure. Besides, he had discovered
something.</p>

<p>&quot;Er&mdash;it is true that I found your stable
empty,&quot; he said, while his eyes probed hers,
&quot;but, curiously enough, it seems to have been
recently occupied.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; was the non-committal reply.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he echoed, with a touch of iron in his
voice. &quot;And you can insure our leaving you
more quickly if you will tell me where these
horses have been hidden.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cary did not raise her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Granted that we <i>had</i> them,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm
afraid I must trouble you to look for them.
Otherwise there would be no sense in trying
to protect my property.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right again,&quot; he acknowledged, but did
not swerve from what he had to do. &quot;Orderly,&quot;
he commanded, &quot;report to Lieutenant
Harris at the stables and have him hunt the
woods and swamp for hidden horses. Hurry!
We must leave in half an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>As Morrison spoke his eye fell on the roadway
and he started perceptibly. When he
turned back to the woman on the bench it was
with a sterner light in his eye.</p>

<p>&quot;I also notice that a horse has recently been
fed and watered in your carriage road.
<i>Whose was he?</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Again that smooth, soft voice with its
languid evasions. &quot;We have several neighbors,
Colonel. They visit us at infrequent
times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But do
you usually feed their horses?&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled faintly. &quot;What little hospitality
is ours extends to both man and beast.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can well believe it,&quot; he replied, for he
saw to cross-examine this quick witted woman
would be forever useless. &quot;And in happier
times I could wish it might extend&mdash;to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I mean no offense,&quot; he interrupted
as Mrs. Cary rose haughtily. &quot;I only want
you to believe that I'm sorry for this intrusion.&quot;</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows faintly and sat
down again. &quot;And was that the reason why
you asked about my neighbor's horse?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said quickly, and as suddenly
caught and held her eye. &quot;There's a Rebel
scout who has been giving us trouble&mdash;a handsome
fellow riding a bay horse. I thought,
perhaps, he might have passed this way.&quot;</p>

<p>If he had thought he would detect anything
in her face he was once more mistaken.</p>

<p>&quot;It is more than possible,&quot; Mrs. Cary remarked
with a touch of weariness. &quot;The
road out there is a public one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And where does it lead to, may I ask?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That depends upon which way you are
traveling&mdash;and which fork you take.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Possibly. But suppose you were riding
north. Wouldn't the right fork lead to Richmond&mdash;and
the left swing around toward the
river crossing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As to that I must refer you to a more competent
authority,&quot; she answered with a hint of
some disclosure in her tones.</p>

<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Jefferson Davis,&quot; she replied and almost
laughed outright as he turned away to
hide his vexation. This was an easy game for
her to play&mdash;and every moment she gained
added to Herbert's safety. But if only she
could hear those three shots from across the
river.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Harris?&quot; said Morrison as his Lieutenant
strode up.</p>

<p>&quot;I have to report, sir, that we've gotten
what little hay and corn there was in the
stables and are waiting for your orders.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; and Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison's
incisive words rang mercilessly in the
listening woman's ears. &quot;Pick out the best
shots you have among your men and send
them at the gallop down this road to the river
crossing. String them along the bank, dismount
them and have them watch as they've
never watched before. You understand?
Now <i>hurry</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>If ever a woman hated a man, or rather the
crushing force he typified, then Herbert
Cary's wife hated this clear headed, efficient
Northerner, who was now discovering how he
had been delayed and thwarted. Yet she had
plenty of spirit left, for as Corporal Dudley
and his file of troopers emerged from the
house she stood up and caught Uncle Billy's
eye.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Corporal?&quot; asked Morrison.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, William?&quot; asked Mrs. Cary.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right, Miss Hallie,&quot; Uncle Billy
grinned. &quot;Dey ain't took nothin'&mdash;not a
single thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, William,&quot; said Mrs. Cary,
having triumphed again. &quot;And thank <i>you</i>,
gentlemen.&quot; With a bow to Morrison she
went superbly back to her seat under the
trees. But as she went it took all her strength
of will to keep from crying. Down the carriage
road a squad of cavalry was galloping
furiously towards the river. And still she
had not heard the three shots.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, then, Corporal, you found what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, sir. We hunted from cellar to
roof. No arms and no rebels.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm,&quot; he mused. &quot;Anything else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Three bedrooms, sir. All in use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Three?&quot; Colonel Morrison exclaimed.
&quot;Very well. That's all. I'll join you in a
moment.&quot; Then he turned to Mrs. Cary, his
face stern with resolve.</p>

<p>&quot;Madam,&quot; he said crisply, &quot;you are not
alone on this plantation with only this old negro.
We are wasting time. I'm after a
Rebel scout and <i>I want him</i>. Which way
did he go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, sir,&quot; she said, quite ready to
play her game again. &quot;But our Rebel scouts
usually neglect to mention their precise intentions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps. If this one went at all. Is he
still here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should imagine&mdash;<i>not</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then he did go this way&mdash;to the river
crossing?&quot;</p>

<p>Once more he caught and held her eyes and
thought he would read the truth in spite of
anything she might say.</p>

<p>But while he looked he saw her strained
face suddenly relax&mdash;saw the anxiety flee
from her eyes&mdash;saw heart and soul take on new
life. From far away across the river had
come some faint popping sounds, regularly
spaced&mdash;<i>three shots</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he said, in wonder. &quot;What is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It <i>sounds</i>,&quot; laughed Herbert Cary's wife,
&quot;like firing. But I think it is a friend of
mine saluting me&mdash;from the safe side of the
river. Good evening, Colonel,&quot; and she
swept by him. She could go find Virgie now.</p>

<p>Just then came the sound of a horse, galloping.
Up the road came a trooper, white with
dust, his animal flecked with foam.</p>

<p>&quot;For Colonel Morrison. Urgent,&quot; he
rasped from a dry throat, as he thudded across
the lawn and dismounted. &quot;From headquarters,&quot;
and he thrust out a dispatch, &quot;I'm
ordered to return with your detachment.&quot;</p>

<p>Snatching the dispatch from the man's
hand Morrison ran his eye over it&mdash;then
started visibly.</p>

<p>&quot;Orderly! Report to Harris double-quick.
Recall the men. Sound boots-and-saddles.
Then bring my horse&mdash;<i>at once!</i> Any details?&quot;
he asked peremptorily of the courier.</p>

<p>&quot;Big battle to-morrow,&quot; the man answered.
&quot;Two gunboats are reported coming up the
river and a wing of the Rebel army is advancing
from Petersburg. Every available
detachment is ordered in. You are to reach
camp before morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right. We'll be there.&quot; Then, as the
bugle sounded, &quot;Ride with us,&quot; he said, and
strode over to where Mrs. Cary stood, arrested
by the news.</p>

<p>&quot;Madam, I must make you a rather hurried
farewell&mdash;and a last apology. If ever we
meet again, I hope the conditions may be
happier&mdash;for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thank you, Colonel,&quot; the proud Southern
woman said sincerely, with a curtsy. &quot;Some
day the 'rebel scout' may thank you also for
me and mine.&quot; And with a smile that augured
friendship when that brighter day
should come she passed out of his sight among
the trees.</p>

<p>For a moment he watched her, proud at
least that this proud woman was of his own
race, then saw that the old negro, her only protector,
still guarded the house.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, old man,&quot; he commanded, &quot;go along
with your mistress and take care of her. I'll
be the last to leave and see that nothing happens
to the house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yas, seh. Thank'e, seh,&quot; said old Uncle
Billy, coming down. &quot;If all of 'em was only
lek you, seh&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Billy suddenly turned and looked up
at the house, his mouth open in consternation.
With a cry of anguish he pointed to an upper
window.</p>

<p>&quot;Look what dey done done,&quot; he shrieked.
&quot;Aw, Gawd a'mighty! Look what dey done
done!&quot;</p>

<p>A cloud of smoke was rolling from the
windows, shot through with yellow jets of
flame. There was the sound of clumsy boots
on the stairs and the door was thrown open.
Dudley, escaped from arrest, ran out with a
flaming pine torch in his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Halt!&quot; cried Morrison, with raging anger.
&quot;Dudley! HALT!&quot;</p>

<p>But Dudley knew that there would be little
use in halting and so ran on until a big revolver
barked behind him and he pitched heavily
forward on his face. Morrison looked down
on the prostrate form and his lips moved sadly,
pityingly:</p>

<p>&quot;And I promised her&mdash;protection!&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>Of all the memories of war, after the dear
dead are buried, there is one that serves to
bring the struggle back in all the intensity
of its horrors&mdash;to stand both as a monument
to those who bled and suffered and as a lonely
sentinel mourning for the peace and plenty
of the past&mdash;a blackened chimney.</p>

<p>Of all the houses, cabins, barns and cribs
which had made up the home of the Carys a
few short months ago nothing remained to-day
but ashes and black ruin. Only one building
had been left unburned and this, before
the war, had been the cabin of an overseer.
It had but two rooms, and a shallow attic,
which was gained by means of an iron ladder
reaching to a closely fitting scuttle in the ceiling.
The larger room was furnished meagerly
with a rough deal table, several common
chairs, and a double-doored cupboard against
the wall. In the deep, wide fire-place glowed
a heap of raked-up embers, on which, suspended
from an iron crane, a kettle simmered,
sadly, as if in grief for her long-lost brother
pots and pans. The plaster on the walls had
broken away in patches, especially above the
door, where the sunlight streamed through
the gaping wound from a cannon shot. The
door and window shutters were of heavy oak,
swinging inward and fastening with bars; yet
now they were open, and through them could
be seen a dreary stretch of river bottom, withering
beneath the rays of a July sun.</p>

<p>Beyond a distant fringe of trees the muddy
James went murmuring down its muddy
banks, where the blue cranes waited solemnly
for the ebbing tide; where the crows cawed
hoarsely in their busy, reeling flight, and the
buzzards swung high above the marshes. Yet
even in this waste of listless desolation came
the echoed boom of heavy guns far down the
river, where the &quot;Rebs&quot; and &quot;Yanks&quot; were
pounding one another lazily.</p>

<p>From the woods which skirted the carriage
road a man appeared&mdash;a thin, worn man, in a
uniform of stained and tattered gray&mdash;a man
who peered from right to left, as a hunted rabbit
might, then darted across the road and
plunged into the briery underbrush. Noiselessly
he made his way to the now deserted
cabin, creeping, crawling till he reached a
point below an open window, then slowly raised
himself and looked within.</p>

<p>&quot;Virgie!&quot; he whispered cautiously. &quot;Virgie!&quot;</p>

<p>No answer came. For a moment the man
leaned dizzily against the windowsill, his eyes
fast closed with a nameless dread, till he
caught his grip again and entered the open
door.</p>

<p>&quot;Virgie!&quot; he called, in a louder tone, moving
swiftly but unsteadily toward the adjoining
room. He flung its door open sharply,
almost angrily; yet the name on his lips was
tender, trembling, as he called: &quot;Virgie!
Virgie!&quot;</p>

<p>In the loneliness of dread, he once more
leaned for support against the wall, wondering,
listening to the pounding of his heart,
to the murmur of the muddy James, and the
fall of a flake of plaster loosened by the dull
reverberation of a distant gun; then suddenly
his eye was caught by the kettle simmering on
the fire, and he sighed in swift relief.</p>

<p>He wiped his brow with a ragged sleeve
and went to where a water-bucket stood behind
the door, knelt beside it, drinking deeply,
gratefully, yet listening the while for unwonted
sounds and watching the bend of
the carriage road. His thirst appeased, he
hunted vainly through the table drawer for
balls and powder for the empty pistol at his
hip; then, instinctively alert to some rustling
sound outside, he crouched toward the adjoining
room, slipped in, and softly closed the
door.</p>

<p>From the sunlit world beyond the cabin
walls rose the murmur of a childish song and
Virgie came pattering in.</p>

<p>She had not changed greatly in stature in
the past few months, but there was a very noticeable
decrease in the girth of her little arms
and body, and her big dark eyes seemed the
larger for the whiteness of her face. On her
head she wore an old calico bonnet several
sizes too large and the gingham dress which
scarcely reached to her bare, brown knees
would not have done, a few months ago, for
even Sally Ann. In one hand Virgie carried
a small tin bucket filled with berries; in the
other she clutched a doll lovingly against her
breast.</p>

<p>Not the old Susan Jemima, but a new Susan
Jemima on whom an equal affection was being
lavished even though she was strangely and
wonderfully made. To the intimate view of
the unimaginative, Susan Jemima was formed
from the limb of a cedar tree, the forking
branches being her arms and legs, her costume
consisting of a piece of rag tied at the waist
with a bit of string.</p>

<p>On a chair at the table Virgie set her doll,
then laughed at the hopelessness of its breakfasting
with any degree of comfort, or of ease.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Lord a-mercy, child, your chin don't
come up to the table.&quot;</p>

<p>On the chair she placed a wooden box,
perching the doll on top and taking a seat
herself just opposite. She emptied the blackberries
into a mutilated plate, brought from
the cupboard a handful of toasted acorns, on
which she poured boiling water, then set the
concoction aside to steep.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Miss Susan Jemima,&quot; said Virgie,
addressing her vis-&agrave;-vis with the hospitable
courtesy due to so great a lady, &quot;we are goin'
to have some breakfas'.&quot; She paused, in a
shade of doubt, then smiled a faint apology:
&quot;It isn't very <i>much</i> of a breakfas', darlin',
but we'll make believe it's waffles an' chicken
an'&mdash;an' hot rolls an' batter-bread an'&mdash;an'
everything.&quot; She rose to her little bare feet,
holding her wisp of a skirt aside, and made a
sweeping bow. &quot;Allow me, Miss Jemima, to
make you a mos' delicious cup of coffee.&quot;</p>

<p>And, while the little hostess prepared the
meal, a man looked out from the partly open
door behind her, with big dark eyes, which
were like her own, yet blurred by a mist of
pity and of love.</p>

<p>&quot;Susan,&quot; said the hostess presently, &quot;it's
ready now, and we'll say grace; so don't you
talk an' annoy your mother.&quot;</p>

<p>The tiny brown head was bowed. The tiny
brown hands, with their berry-stained fingers,
were placed on the table's edge; but Miss
Susan Jemima sat bolt upright, though listening,
it seemed, to the words of reverence falling
from a mother-baby's lips:</p>

<p>&quot;Lord, make us thankful for the blackberries
an' the aco'n coffee an'&mdash;an' all our
blessin's; but please, sir, sen' us somethin' that
tastes jus' a little better&mdash;if you don't mind.
Amen!&quot;</p>

<p>And the man, who leaned against the door
and watched, had also bowed his head. A
pain was in his throat&mdash;and in his heart&mdash;a
pain that gripped him, till two great tears
rolled down his war-worn cheek and were lost
in his straggling beard.</p>

<p>&quot;Virgie!&quot; he whispered hoarsely. &quot;Virgie!&quot;</p>

<p>She started at the sound and looked about
her, wondering; then, as the name was called
again, she slid from her chair and ran forward
with a joyous cry:</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Daddy! Is it you? Is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She stopped, for the man had placed a
finger on his lip and was pointing to the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Take a look down the road,&quot; he ordered,
in a guarded voice; and, when she had reached
a point commanding the danger zone, he
asked, &quot;See anybody?&mdash;soldiers?&quot; She shook
her head. &quot;Hear anything?&quot;</p>

<p>She stood for a moment listening, then ran
to him, and sprang into his waiting arms.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right, Daddy! It's all right
now!&quot;</p>

<p>He raised her, strained her to his breast,
his cheek against her own.</p>

<p>&quot;My little girl!&quot; he murmured between his
kisses. &quot;My little rebel!&quot; And as she
snuggled in his arms, her berry-stained fingers
clasped tightly about his neck, he asked her
wistfully, &quot;Did you miss me?&mdash;<i>awful</i> much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she nodded, looking into his eyes.
&quot;Yes&mdash;in the night time&mdash;when the wind was
talkin'; but, after while, when&mdash;Why,
Daddy!&quot; He had staggered as he set her
down, sinking into a chair and closing his eyes
as he leaned on the table's edge. &quot;You
are hurt!&quot; she cried. &quot;I&mdash;I can see the
blood!&quot;</p>

<p>The wounded Southerner braced himself.</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear, no,&quot; he strove to reassure her.
&quot;It isn't anything; only a little scratch&mdash;from
a Yank&mdash;that tried to get me. But he didn't,
though,&quot; the soldier added with a smile. &quot;I'm
just&mdash;tired.&quot;</p>

<p>The child regarded him in wondering awe,
speaking in a half-breathed whisper:</p>

<p>&quot;Did he&mdash;did he <i>shoot</i> at you?&quot;</p>

<p>Her father nodded, with his hand on her
tumbled hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, honey, I'm afraid he did; but I'm so
used to it now I don't mind it any more. Get
me a drink of water, will you?&quot; As Virgie
obeyed in silence, returning with the dripping
gourd, the man went on: &quot;I tried to get here
yesterday; but I couldn't. They chased me
when I came before&mdash;and now they're watching.&quot;
He paused to sip at his draught of
water, glancing toward the carriage road.
&quot;Big fight down the river. Listen! Can you
hear the guns?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, plain,&quot; she answered, tilting her tiny
head. &quot;An' las' night, when I went to bed,
I could hear 'em&mdash;oh! ever so loud: Boom!
Boom! Boom-boom! So I knelt up an'
asked the Lord not to let any of 'em hit you.&quot;</p>

<p>Two arms, in their tattered gray, slipped
round the child. He kissed her, in that
strange, fierce passion of a man who has lost
his mate, and his grief-torn love is magnified
in the mite who reflects her image and her
memory.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you, honey?&quot; he asked, with a trembling
lip. &quot;Well, I reckon that saved your
daddy, for not one shell touched him&mdash;no, not
one!&quot; He kissed her again, and laughed.
&quot;And I tell you, Virgie, they were coming as
thick as bees.&quot;</p>

<p>Once more he sipped at the grateful, cooling
draught of water, when the child asked
suddenly:</p>

<p>&quot;How is Gen'ral Lee?&quot;</p>

<p>Down came the gourd upon the table. The
Southerner was on his feet, with a stiffened
back; and his dusty slouch hat was in his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;He's well; God bless him! Well!&quot;</p>

<p>The tone was deep and tender, proud, but
as reverent as the baby's prayer for her father's
immunity from harm; yet the man who spoke
sank back into his seat, closing his eyes and
repeating slowly, sadly:</p>

<p>&quot;He's well; God bless him! But he's tired,
darling&mdash;mighty tired.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; the soldier's daughter asked, &quot;will
you tell him somethin'&mdash;from me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear. What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell him,&quot; said the child, with a thoughtful
glance at Miss Susan Jemima across the table,
&quot;tell him, if he ever marches along this way,
I'll come over to his tent and rub his head, like
I do yours&mdash;if he'll let me&mdash;till he goes to
sleep.&quot; She clasped her fingers and looked
into her father's eyes, hopefully, appealingly.
&quot;Do you think he would, if&mdash;if I washed my
hands&mdash;real clean?&quot;</p>

<p>The Southerner bit his lip and tried to smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, honey, I know he would! And think!
He sent a message&mdash;to <i>you</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he?&quot; she asked, wide-eyed, flushed with
happiness. &quot;What did he say, Daddy?
What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He said,&quot; her father answered, taking her
hands in his: &quot;'She's a brave little soldier, to
stay there all alone. Dixie and I are proud
of her!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Daddy, did he? Did he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear, yes,&quot; the soldier nodded; &quot;his
very words. And look!&quot; From his boot leg
he took a folded paper and spread it on his
knee. &quot;He wrote you a pass&mdash;to Richmond.
Can you read it?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie leaned against her father's shoulder,
studying the paper long and earnestly; then,
presently looked up, with a note of grave but
courteous hesitation in her tone:</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;he&mdash;well, the Gen'ral writes a awful
bad hand, Daddy.&quot;</p>

<p>Her father laughed in genuine delight, vowing
in his heart to tell his general and friend
of this crushing criticism, if ever the fates of
war permitted them to meet again.</p>

<p>&quot;Dead right!&quot; he agreed, with hearty
promptness. &quot;But come, I'll read it for you.
Now then. Listen:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VA.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Pass Virginia Cary and escort through all Confederate
lines and give safe-conduct wherever possible.</i></p>

<p>&quot;R.E. LEE, <i>General</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then Virgie
looked up, with tears in her eyes and voice.</p>

<p>&quot;An' he did that&mdash;for little <i>me</i>? Oh,
Daddy, I love him so much, it&mdash;it makes me
want to cry.&quot;</p>

<p>She hid her face on the coat of gray, and
sobbed; while her father stroked her hair and
answered soothingly, but in a tone of mourning
reverie:</p>

<p>&quot;So do we all, darling; big grown men, who
have suffered, and are losing all they love.
They are ragged&mdash;and wounded&mdash;hungry&mdash;and,
oh, so tired! But, when they think of
<i>him</i>, they draw up their belts another hole, and
say, '<i>For General Lee!</i>' And then they can
fight and fight and fight&mdash;till their hearts stop
beating&mdash;and the god of battles writes them
a bloody pass!&quot;</p>

<p>Again he had risen to his feet. He was
speaking proudly, in the reckless passion of
the yet unconquered Southerner, only half-conscious
of the tot who watched him, wondering.
So she came to him quickly, taking
his hand in both her own, and striving to bring
him comfort from the fountain of her little
mother-heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you worry, Daddy-man. We'll&mdash;we'll
whip 'em yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear&mdash;no,&quot; he sighed, as he dropped
into his seat. &quot;We won't. It's hard enough
on men; but harder still on children such as
you.&quot; He turned to her gravely, earnestly:
&quot;Virgie, I had hoped to get you through to
Richmond&mdash;to-day. But I can't. The Yankees
have cut us off. They are up the
river and down the river&mdash;and all around us,
I've been nearly the whole night getting here;
creeping through the woods&mdash;like an old
Molly-cotton-tail&mdash;with the blue boys everywhere,
waiting to get me if I showed my head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they didn't, did they?&quot; said Virgie,
laughing at his reference to the wise old rabbit
and feeling for the pockets of his shabby coat,
&quot;Did you&mdash;did you bring me anything?&quot;</p>

<p>At her question the man cried out as if in
pain, then reached for her in a wave of yearning
tenderness.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, dear; I&mdash;I had a little bundle for
you&mdash;of&mdash;of things to eat.&quot; He took her by
the arms, and looked into her quaint, wise face,
&quot;And I was so glad I had it, darling, for you
are thinner than you were.&quot; He paused to
bite his lip, and continued haltingly, &quot;There
was bread in that bundle&mdash;and meat&mdash;real
meat&mdash;and sugar&mdash;and tea.&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie released herself and clapped her
hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Daddy, where is it?&quot; she asked him
happily, once more reaching for the pocket.
&quot;'Cause I'm <i>so</i> hungry for somethin' good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't! Don't!&quot; he cried, as he drew his
coat away, roughly, fiercely, in the pain
of unselfish suffering. &quot;For Daddy's sake,
don't!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, what is it, Daddy,&quot; she asked, in
her shrillness of a child's alarm, her eyes on
the widening stain of red above his waist. &quot;Is&mdash;is
it hurtin' you again? What is it, Daddy-man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your bundle,&quot; he answered, in the flat,
dull tone of utter hopelessness. &quot;I lost it,
Virgie. I lost it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, with a quaver of disappointment,
which she vainly strove to hide. &quot;How
did you do it?&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment the man leaned limply
against a chair-back, hiding his eyes with one
trembling hand; then he spoke in shamed
apology:</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I couldn't help it, darling; because,
you see, I hadn't any powder left; and I was
coming through the woods&mdash;just as I told you&mdash;when
the Yanks got sight of me.&quot; He
smiled down at her bravely, striving to add a
dash of comedy to his tragic plight. &quot;And I
tell you, Virgie, your old dad had to run like
a turkey&mdash;wishing to the Lord he had wings,
too.&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie did not smile in turn, and her father
dropped back into his former tone, his pale
lips setting in a straight, hard line.</p>

<p>&quot;And then&mdash;the blue boy I was telling you
about&mdash;when he shot at me, I must have stumbled,
because, when I scrambled up, I&mdash;I
couldn't see just right; so I ran and ran, thinking
of you, darling, and wanting to get to you
before&mdash;well, before it was breakfast time. I
had your bundle in my pocket; but when I
fell&mdash;why, Virgie, don't you see?&mdash;I&mdash;I
couldn't go back and find it.&quot; He paused to
choke, then spoke between his teeth, in fury
at a strength which had failed to breast a barrier
of fate: &quot;But I <i>would</i> have gone back, if
I'd had any powder left. I <i>would</i> have! I
would!&quot;</p>

<p>A pitiful apology it was, from a man to a
little child; a story told only in its hundredth
part, for why should he give its untold horrors
to a baby's ears? How could she understand
that man-hunt in the early dawn? The fugitive&mdash;with
an empty pistol on his hip&mdash;wading
swamps and plunging through the tangled
underbrush; alert and listening, darting from
tree to tree where the woods were thin; crouching
behind some fallen log to catch his laboring
breath, then rising again to creep along
his way. He did not tell of the racking pain
in his weary legs, nor the protest of his pounding
heart&mdash;the strain&mdash;the agony&mdash;the puffs
of smoke that floated above the pines, and the
ping of bullets whining through the trees. He
did not tell of the ball that slid along his ribs,
leaving a fiery, aching memory behind, as the
man crashed down a clay bank, to lie for an
instant in a crumpled heap, to rise and stumble
on&mdash;not toward the haven of his own Confederate
lines, but forward, to where a baby
waited&mdash;through a dancing mist of red.</p>

<p>And so the soldier made his poor apology,
turning his head away to avoid a dreaded look
in Virgie's big, reproachful eyes; then he
added one more lashwelt to his shame:</p>

<p>&quot;And now your poor old daddy is no more
use to you. I come to my little girl with
empty hands&mdash;with an empty gun&mdash;and an
empty heart!&quot;</p>

<p>He said it bitterly, in the self-accusing
sorrow of his soul; and his courage, which had
borne him through a hell of suffering, now
broke; but only when a helper of the helpless
failed. He laid his outflung arms across the
table. He bowed his beaten head upon them
and sobbed aloud, with sobs that shook him
to his heels.</p>

<p>It was then that Virgie came to him again,
a little daughter of the South, who, like a hundred
thousand of her sisters, brought comfort
in the blackest hours.</p>

<p>One tiny, weak arm was slipped about his
neck. One tiny brown hand, with its berry-stained
fingers, was run through his tangled
hair, softly, tenderly, even as she longed to
soothe the weary head of General Lee.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't cry, Daddy-man,&quot; she murmured in
his ear; &quot;it's all right. <i>I</i> can eat the blackberries.
They&mdash;they don't taste so <i>awful</i> good
when you have 'em <i>all</i> the time; but <i>I</i> don't
mind.&quot; She paused to kiss him, then tried
once more to buoy his hope and hers. &quot;We'll
have jus' heaps of things when we get to Richmon'&mdash;jus'
heaps&mdash;an' then&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, lifting her head and
listening, in the manner of a sheep dog scenting
danger from afar. Her father looked up
sharply and gripped her hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Virgie! You hear&mdash;<i>what</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Horses! Oh, a lot of 'em! On the big
road!&quot;</p>

<p>It was true, for down the breeze came the
faintly echoed thud of many hoofs and the
clinking jingle of sabers against the riders'
thighs. Virgie turned back from the open
door.</p>

<p>&quot;Why&mdash;why, they've turned into <i>our</i> road!&quot;
Her breath came fast, as she sank her voice
to a faint, awed whisper, &quot;Daddy&mdash;do you
reckon it's&mdash;<i>Yankees</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said her father, who had risen to
his feet. &quot;Morrison's cavalry! They won't
hurt <i>you</i>; but I'll have to get to the woods
again! Good-by, honey! Good-by!&quot;</p>

<p>He kissed her hurriedly and started for the
door, but shrank into the shadow at sight of a
blue-clothed watcher sharply outlined on the
crest of a distant rise. Escape was cut off,
and the hunted soldier turned to Virgie in his
need.</p>

<p>&quot;Shut the door&mdash;quick!&quot; She obeyed in
silence. &quot;Lock it!&quot; She turned the rusty
key, and waited. &quot;Now the windows!
Hurry, but do it quietly.&quot;</p>

<p>She closed the clumsy shutters and set the
heavy bars into their slots; then the man came
forward, knelt down before her and took her
hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, Virginia,&quot; he whispered earnestly;
&quot;don't you remember how your dear, dear
mother&mdash;and I, too, darling&mdash;always told you
never to tell a lie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An' I haven't, Daddy-man,&quot; she protested,
wondering. &quot;'Deed, an' 'deed, I haven't.
Why&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I know,&quot; he interrupted hurriedly;
&quot;but now&mdash;<i>you must</i>!&quot; As the child
stepped backward and tried to draw away, he
clasped her hands more tightly still. &quot;But
listen, dear; it's to save <i>me</i>! Don't you understand?&mdash;and
it's <i>right</i>! When those men
come, they mustn't find me. Say I <i>was</i> here,
but I've gone. If they ask which way, tell
them I went down past the spring&mdash;through
the blackberry patch. Do you understand?&mdash;and
can you remember?&quot; She nodded
gravely, and the Southerner folded her tightly
in his arms. &quot;Be a brave little rebel, honey&mdash;<i>for
me</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>He released her and began to mount the ladder
leading to the scuttle in the ceiling; but
halfway up he paused, as Virgie checked him
with a solemn question:</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy&mdash;would Gen'ral Lee want me to
tell that lie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; he answered slowly, thoughtfully;
&quot;this once! And, if ever you see him,
ask him, and he'll tell you so himself. God
help you, darling; it's for General Lee&mdash;and
<i>you</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>The littlest rebel sighed, as though a weight
had been lifted from her mind, and she cocked
her head at the sound of louder hoof-beats on
the carriage road.</p>

<p>&quot;All right, Daddy-man. I'll tell&mdash;a <i>whopper</i>!&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>The man crawled up through the scuttle hole
and disappeared; then drew the ladder after
him and closed the trap, while Virgie tiptoed
to the table and slipped into a seat.</p>

<p>The cabin was now in semi-darkness, except
for a shaft of sunlight entering through the
jagged wound from the cannon-shot above the
door; and it fell on the quaint, brown head of
little Miss Virginia Cary, and the placid form
of Susan Jemima, perching opposite, in serene
contempt of the coming of a conquering host.</p>

<p>The jingling clank of sabers grew louder
to the listeners' ears, through the rumble of
pounding hoofs; a bugle's note came winnowing
across the fields, and Virgie leaned forward
with a confidential whisper to her doll:</p>

<p>&quot;Susan Jemima, I wouldn't tell anybody
else&mdash;no, not for anything&mdash;but I cert'n'y am
awful scared!&quot;</p>

<p>There came a scurrying rush, a command to
halt, and a rustling, scraping noise of dismounting
men; a pause, and the sharp, loud
rap of a saber hilt against the door. Virgie
breathed hard, but made no answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Open up!&quot; called a voice outside, but the
little rebel closed her lips and sat staring at
Susan Jemima across the table. A silence
followed, short, yet filled with dread; then
came a low-toned order and the crash of carbine
butts on the stout oak door. For a time
it resisted hopefully, then slowly its top sagged
in, with a groaning, grating protest from its
rusty hinges; it swayed, collapsed in a cloud of
dust&mdash;and the enemy swept over it.</p>

<p>They came with a rush; in the lead an officer,
a naked saber in his fist, followed by a squad
of grim-faced troopers, each with his carbine
cocked and ready for discharge. Yet, as suddenly
as they had come, they halted now at the
sight of a little lady, seated at table, eating
berries, as calmly as though the dogs of war
had never even growled.</p>

<p>A wondering silence followed, till broken
by a piping voice, in grave but courteous reproof:</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I don't think you are very polite.&quot;</p>

<p>The officer in command was forced to smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, my dear,&quot; he apologized; &quot;but
am afraid, this time, I can't quite help it.&quot;
He glanced at the door of the adjoining room
and turned to his waiting men, though speaking
in an undertone: &quot;He's in there, I guess.
Don't fire if you can help it&mdash;on account of
the baby. Now then! Steady, boys! Advance!&quot;</p>

<p>He led the way, six troopers following,
while the rest remained behind to guard the
cabin's open door. Virgie slowly turned her
head, with eyes that watched the officer's every
move; then presently she called:</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, there! That's <i>my</i> room&mdash;an' don't
you-all bother any of my things, either!&quot;</p>

<p>This one command, at least, was implicitly
obeyed, for in a moment the disappointed
squad returned. The carbine butts were
grounded; the troopers stood at orderly attention,
while their officer stepped toward the
table.</p>

<p>&quot;What's your name, little monkey?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie raised her eyes in swift reproach.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't like to be called a monkey. It&mdash;it
isn't respectful.&quot;</p>

<p>The Union soldier laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;O-ho! I see.&quot; He touched his hat and
made her a sweeping bow. &quot;A thousand pardons,
Mademoiselle.&quot; He shot his sword into
its scabbard, and laughed again. &quot;Might I
inquire as to what you are called by your&mdash;er&mdash;justly
respectful relatives and friends?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Virgie,&quot; she answered simply.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; he approved, &quot;and a very pretty
name! Virgie what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My whole name is Miss Virginia Houston
Gary.&quot;</p>

<p>The soldier started, glanced at his troopers,
then back to the child again:</p>

<p>&quot;Is Herbert Cary your father?&quot;</p>

<p>He waited for her answer, and got it,
straight from a baby's shoulder:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Mister</i> Herbert Cary is&mdash;yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The enemy smiled and made her another
bow.</p>

<p>&quot;I stand corrected. Where is your father
now?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie hesitated.</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>The voice of her inquisitor took on a sterner
tone:</p>

<p>&quot;Is he here?&mdash;hiding somewhere? Tell
me!&quot;</p>

<p>Her little heart was pounding, horribly, and
the hot blood came into her cheeks; but she
looked him squarely in the face, and lied&mdash;for
General Lee:</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir. Daddy <i>was</i> here&mdash;but he's gone
away.&quot;</p>

<p>The enemy was looking at her, intently, and
his handsome, piercing eyes, grew most uncomfortable.
She hung for an instant between
success and sobbing failure, till a bubble
from Mother Eve rose up in her youthful
blood and burst into a spray of perfect feminine
deceit. She did not try to add to her
simple statement, but began to eat her berries,
calmly, as though the subject were completely
closed.</p>

<p>&quot;Which way did he go?&quot; the officer demanded,
and she pointed with her spoon.</p>

<p>&quot;Down by the spring&mdash;through the blackberry
patch.&quot;</p>

<p>The soldier was half-convinced. He stood
for a moment, looking at the floor, then asked
her sharply, suddenly:</p>

<p>&quot;If your father had gone, then why did you
lock that door?&quot;</p>

<p>She faltered, but only for an instant.</p>

<p>&quot;'Cause I thought you might be&mdash;<i>niggers</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>The man before her clenched his hands, as
he thought of that new-born, hideous danger
menacing the South.</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; he answered gently; &quot;<i>yes</i>, I see.&quot;
He turned away, but, even as he turned, his
eye was caught by the double-doored cupboard
against the wall. &quot;What do you keep in
there?&quot; he asked; and the child smiled faintly,
a trifle sadly, in reply:</p>

<p>&quot;We <i>used</i> to keep things to eat&mdash;when we
had any.&quot;</p>

<p>He noted her mild evasion, and pushed the
point.</p>

<p>&quot;What is in it now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tin pans.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anything else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Er&mdash;yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>He caught his breath and stepped a little
nearer, bending till his face was close to
hers.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Colonel Mosby,&quot; declared the mite, with a
most emphatic nod; &quot;an' you better look out,
too!&quot;</p>

<p>The officer laughed as he turned to his grinning
squad.</p>

<p>&quot;Bright little youngster! Still, I think we'll
have a look.&quot; He dropped his air of amusement,
growing stern again. &quot;Now, men!
Ready!&quot;</p>

<p>They swung into line and faced the cupboard,
the muzzles of their carbines trained
upon it, while their leader advanced, swung
open the doors, and quickly stepped aside.</p>

<p>On the bottom shelf, as Virgie had declared,
were a few disconsolate tin pans; yet tacked
to the door was a picture print of Mosby&mdash;that
dreaded guerrilla whose very name was a bugaboo
in the Union lines.</p>

<p>The littlest rebel flung back her head and
laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;My, but you looked funny!&quot; she cried to
the somewhat disconcerted officer, pointing at
him with her spoon. &quot;If a mouse had jumped
out, I reckon it would have scared you mos' to
death.&quot;</p>

<p>The officer's cheeks flushed red, in spite of
his every effort at control; nor was he assisted
by the knowledge that his men were tittering
behind his back. He turned upon them
sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;That will do,&quot; he said, and gave a brusque
command: &quot;Corporal, deploy your men and
make a thorough search outside. Examine
the ground around the spring&mdash;and report!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; returned Corporal Dudley saluting
and dropping his hand across his mouth
to choke off an exclamation of anger. Then
he snarled at his men, to ease the pain of
thwarted vengeance: &quot;<i>'Tention! Right face!
Forward! March!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>The squad trooped out across the broken
door, leaving their commanding officer alone
with his rebel prisoner.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Virgie,&quot; he asked, in a kindly tone,
though holding her eyes with his, &quot;do you mean
to tell me&mdash;cross your heart&mdash;that you are
here, just by yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Er&mdash;no, sir.&quot; As he opened his lips to
speak, she pointed to her doll. &quot;Me an' Susan
Jemima.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that's a fact,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Hanged
if I'm not losing all my social polish.&quot; He
gallantly removed his hat, bowed gravely to
the cedar stick, and shook its hand. &quot;Charmed
to make your acquaintance, Miss Susan, believe
me. My own name is Morrison&mdash;Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrison&mdash;at your service.&quot;
He turned to the little mother with a smile that
showed a row of white and even teeth. &quot;And
now,&quot; he said, &quot;since we are all informally introduced,
suppose we have a quiet, comfortable
chat.&quot; He paused, but she made no answer.
&quot;Well? Aren't you going to ask me
to have some breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie cast a troubled gaze into the plate
before her.</p>

<p>&quot;Er&mdash;no, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? Why not?&quot;</p>

<p>She faltered, and answered slowly:</p>

<p>&quot;'Cause&mdash;'cause you're one of the damn
Yankees.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! oh! oh!&quot; exclaimed the soldier, shocked
to hear a baby's lips profaned. &quot;Little girls
shouldn't use such words. Why, Virgie!&quot;</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, clear, fearless, filled with
vindicating innocence.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's your <i>name</i>, isn't it? <i>Everybody</i>
calls you that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um&mdash;yes,&quot; he admitted, striving to check
the twitching of his lips; &quot;I suppose they do&mdash;south
of Washington. But don't you know
we are just like other people?&quot; She shook her
head. &quot;Oh, yes, we are. Why, <i>I</i> have a little
girl at home&mdash;not any bigger than you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you?&quot; asked Virgie, her budding
racial prejudice at war with youthful curiosity.
&quot;What's her name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gertrude,&quot; he answered softly, tenderly.
&quot;Gertrude Morrison. Would you like to see
her picture?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the little rebel, and stepped
across the gulf which had lain between her and
her enemy. &quot;You can sit down if you want
to. Jus' put Susan Jemima on the table.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; returned her visitor, obeying
instructions, seating himself and loosening the
upper buttons of his coat. On his neck, suspended
by a chain, was a silver locket containing
the miniature of a plump and pretty child.
It had lain there since the war began, through
many a bivouac, many a weary march, and
even in the charge he could feel it tapping
against his breast; so now, as he held it out to
Virgie, the father's hand was trembling.</p>

<p>&quot;There she is. My Gertrude&mdash;my little
Gertrude.&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she said, in unaffected admiration,
&quot;She's <i>mighty</i> pretty. She's&mdash;&quot; The child
stopped suddenly, and raised her eyes. &quot;An'
she's fat, too. I reckon Gertrude gets lots
to eat, doesn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes,&quot; agreed the father, thinking of
his comfortable Northern home; &quot;of course.
Don't you?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie weighed the question thoughtfully
before she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes&mdash;when Daddy gets through the
lines and brings it to me.&quot;</p>

<p>The soldier started violently, wrenched back
from the selfish dream of happiness that rose
as he looked at the picture of his child.</p>

<p>&quot;What! Is <i>that</i> why your father comes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know! I thought he came&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and turned away, his
thoughts atumble, a pang of parental pity
gnawing at his heart; then he wheeled and
faced her, asking, with a break in his husky
voice:</p>

<p>&quot;And at other times&mdash;what do you eat,
then?&quot;</p>

<p>She made a quaint, depreciating gesture toward
the appointments of her breakfast table.</p>

<p>&quot;Blackberries&mdash;an'&mdash;an' coffee made out of
aco'ns.&quot;</p>

<p>Again the troubled conqueror turned away.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's a shame!&quot; he muttered between his
teeth. &quot;A wicked shame!&quot;</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, silently, till Virgie
spoke and jarred him with another confidence.</p>

<p>&quot;My cousin Norris told me that the Yankees
have bread every day; an' tea&mdash;an' milk&mdash;an'
everything. <i>An' butter!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>This last-named article of common diet was
mentioned with an air of reverential awe; and,
somehow, it hurt the well-fed Union officer far
more than had she made some direct accusation
against the invading armies of the North.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't, Virgie&mdash;please,&quot; he murmured
softly. &quot;There are some things we just can't
bear to listen to&mdash;even in times of war.&quot; He
sighed and dropped into his former seat, striving
gently to change the subject. &quot;You have
lived here&mdash;always?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she assured him, with a lift of her
small, patrician brows. &quot;<i>This</i> is the overseer's
house. <i>Our</i> house used to be up on the hill,
in the grove.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Used</i> to be&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir. But&mdash;but the Yankees burnt it
up.&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison's fist came down on the table with
a crash. He remembered now his raid of some
months before upon this same plantation, so
unfamiliar in its present neglected state.
Again he looked into the fearless eyes of a
Southern gentlewoman who mocked him while
her lover husband swam the river and escaped.
Again he saw the mansion wrapped in flame
and smoke&mdash;the work of a drunken fiend in
his own command. Yes, he remembered now;
too well; then he turned to the child and spoke:</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me about it. Won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>She nodded, wriggled from her chair, and
stood beside the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it was a long time ago&mdash;a month,
maybe&mdash;an' they came after our horses.
Mamma an' me were all by ourselves&mdash;'ceptin'
Uncle Billy and Sally Ann. An' we were
dreadful scared&mdash;an' we hid in the ice house.&quot;</p>

<p>She paused. Her listener had leaned his
elbow on the table, his hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear. Go on.&quot;</p>

<p>The child had been standing opposite, with
Susan Jemima and the acorn-coffee pot between
them; but gradually she began to edge
a little nearer, till presently she stood beside
him, fingering a shiny button on his coat.</p>

<p>&quot;An' the blue boys ate up everything we
had&mdash;an' took our corn. An' when they went
away from our house, they&mdash;a man set it on
fire. But another man got real mad with him,
an'&mdash;an' shot him. <i>I</i> know, 'cause Uncle
Billy put him in the ground.&quot; She paused,
then sank her voice to a whisper of mysterious
dread, &quot;An'&mdash;<i>an' I saw him!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't think about it, Virgie,&quot; begged Morrison,
slipping his arm about the mite, and trying
not to put his own beloved ones in the little
rebel's place. &quot;What happened then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We came to live here,&quot; said Virgie; &quot;but
Mamma got sick. Oh, she got terrible sick&mdash;an'
one night Daddy came through, and put
her in the ground, too. But <i>he</i> says she's jus'
asleep.&quot;</p>

<p>The soldier started. Mrs. Cary dead?
This poor tot motherless? He drew the baby
closer to him, stroking her hair, as her sleeping
mother might have done, and waited for the rest.</p>

<p>&quot;An' las' Friday, Sally Ann went away&mdash;I
don't know where&mdash;an'&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; asked Morrison. &quot;She left you
here&mdash;all by yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the child, with a careless
laugh. &quot;But <i>I</i> don't mind. Sally Ann was
a triflin' nigger, anyhow. You see&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; he interrupted, &quot;what became
of the old colored man who&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Billy? Yes, sir. We sent him up
to Richmond&mdash;to get some things, but he can't
come back&mdash;the Yankees won't let him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Won't they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir. An' Daddy's been tryin' to get
me up to Richmon', where my Aunt Margaret
lives at, but he can't&mdash;'cause the Yankees are
up the river an' down the river, an'&mdash;an' everywhere&mdash;an'
he can't.&quot; She paused, as Morrison
turned to her from his restless pacing up
and down. &quot;My, but you've got fine clo'es!
Daddy's clo'es are all rags&mdash;with&mdash;with holes
in 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>He could not answer. There was nothing
for him to say, and Virgie scorched him with
another question:</p>

<p>&quot;What did you come after Daddy for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, not because I <i>wanted</i> to, little girl,&quot;
he burst out harshly. &quot;But you wouldn't understand.&quot;
He had turned away, and was
gazing through the open door, listening to the
muttered wrath of the big black guns far down
the river. &quot;It's war! One of the hateful,
pitiful things of war! I came because I had
my orders.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From your Gen'ral?&quot;</p>

<p>He lowered his chin, regarding her in mild
astonishment.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;my General.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An' do you love <i>him</i>&mdash;like <i>I</i> love Gen'ral
Lee?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; he answered earnestly; &quot;of
course.&quot;</p>

<p>He wondered again to see her turn away in
sober thought, tracing lines on the dusty floor
with one small brown toe; for the child was
wrestling with a problem. If a soldier had
orders from his general, as she herself might
put it, &quot;he was <i>bound</i> to come&quot;; but still it was
hard to reconcile such duty with the capture of
her father. Therefore, she raised her tiny chin
and resorted to tactics of a purely personal
nature:</p>

<p>&quot;An' didn't you know, if you hurt my
daddy, I'd tell Uncle Fitz Lee on you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; the Yankee smiled. &quot;Is he your
uncle?&quot;</p>

<p>The littlest rebel regarded him with a look
of positive pity for his ignorance.</p>

<p>&quot;He's <i>everybody's</i> uncle,&quot; she stated
warmly. &quot;An' if I was to tell him, he'd come
right after you an'&mdash;an' lick the <i>stuffins</i> out
of you.&quot;</p>

<p>The soldier laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;My dear,&quot; he confided, with a dancing
twinkle in hip eye, &quot;to tell you the honest truth,
your Uncle Fitz has done it already&mdash;<i>several</i>
times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has he?&quot; she cried, in rapturous delight.
&quot;Oh, <i>has</i> he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has,&quot; the enemy repeated, with vigor
and conviction. &quot;But suppose we shift our
conversation to matters a shade more pleasant.
Take you, for instance. You see&mdash;&quot; He
stopped abruptly, turning his head and listening
with keen intentness. &quot;What's that?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>I</i> didn't hear anything,&quot; said Virgie, breathing
very fast; but she too had heard it&mdash;a
sound above them, a scraping sound, as of
someone lying flat along the rafters and shifting
his position and, while she spoke, a telltale
bit of plaster fell, and broke as it struck
the floor.</p>

<p>Morrison looked up, starting as he saw the
outlines of the closely fitting scuttle, for the
loft was so low and shallow that he had not
suspected its presence from an outside view;
but now he was certain of the fugitive's hiding-place.
Virgie watched him, trembling, growing
hot in the pit of her little stomach; yet,
when he faced her, she looked him squarely in
the eye, fighting one last battle for her daddy&mdash;as
hopeless as the tottering cause of the
Stars and Bars.</p>

<p>&quot;You&mdash;you don't think he can fly, do
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, little Rebel,&quot; the soldier answered
gently, sadly; &quot;but there are other ways.&quot;
He glanced at the table, measuring its height
with the pitch of the ceiling, then turned to her
again: &quot;Is your father in that loft?&quot; She
made no answer, but began to back away.
&quot;Tell me the truth. Look at me!&quot; Still no
answer, and he took a step toward her, speaking
sternly: &quot;Do you hear me? <i>Look</i> at
me!&quot;</p>

<p>She tried; but her courage was oozing fast.
She had done her best, but now it was more
than the mite could stand; so she bit her lip
to stop its quivering, and turned her head
away. For a moment the man stood, silent,
wondering if it was possible that the child had
been coached in a string of lies to trade upon
his tenderness of heart; then he spoke, in a
voice of mingled pity and reproach:</p>

<p>&quot;And so you told me a story. And all the
rest&mdash;is a story, too. Oh, Virgie! Virgie!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't!&quot; she cried, the big tears breaking,
out at last. &quot;I didn't tell you stories'. Only
jus' a <i>little</i> one&mdash;for Daddy&mdash;an' Gen'ral
Lee.&quot;</p>

<p>She was sobbing now, and the man looked
down upon her in genuine compassion, his own
eyes swimming at her childish grief, his soldier
heart athrob and aching at the duty he must
perform.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, dear,&quot; he sighed, removing her
doll and dragging the table across the floor
to a point directly beneath the scuttle in the
ceiling.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you goin' to do?&quot; she asked in
terror, following as he moved. &quot;Oh, what are
you goin' to do?&quot;</p>

<p>He did not reply. He could not; but when
he placed a chair upon the table and prepared
to mount, then Virgie understood.</p>

<p>&quot;You shan't! You shan't!&quot; she cried out
shrilly. &quot;He's my daddy&mdash;and you shan't.&quot;</p>

<p>She pulled at the table, and when he would
have put her aside, as gently as he could, she
attacked him fiercely, in a childish storm of
passion, sobbing, striking at him with her
puny fists. The soldier bowed his head and
moved away.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I can't! I can't!&quot; he breathed, in conscience-stricken
pain. &quot;There <i>must</i> be some
other way; and still&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He stood irresolute, gazing through the
open door, watching his men as they hunted
for a fellow man; listening to the sounds that
floated across the stricken fields&mdash;the calls of
his troopers; the locusts in the sun-parched
woods chanting their shrill, harsh litany of
drought; but more insistent still came the
muffled boom of the big black guns far down
the muddy James. They called to him, these
guns, in the hoarse-tongued majesty of war,
bidding him forget himself, his love, his pity&mdash;all
else, but the grim command to a marching
host&mdash;a host that must reach its goal, though
it marched on a road of human hearts.</p>

<p>The soldier set his teeth and turned to the
little rebel, deciding on his course of action;
best for her, best for the man who lay in the
loft above, though now it must seem a brutal
cruelty to both.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Virgie,&quot; he said, &quot;since you haven't
told me what I want to know, I'll have to take
you&mdash;and give you to the Yankees.&quot;</p>

<p>He stepped toward her swiftly and caught
her by the wrist. She screamed in terror, fighting
to break his hold, while the trap above
them opened, and the head and shoulders of
the Southerner appeared, his pistol held in his
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Drop it, you hound!&quot; he ordered fiercely.
&quot;Drop it!&quot;</p>

<p>The Northerner released his captive, but
stood unmoved as he looked into the pistol's
muzzle and the blazing eyes of the cornered
scout.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he said, in quiet dignity. &quot;I'm
very sorry; but I had to bring you out.&quot; He
paused, then spoke again: &quot;And you needn't
bother about your gun. If you'd had any
ammunition, our fire would have been returned,
back yonder in the woods. The
game's up, Cary. Come down!&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>The head and shoulders disappeared. A
short pause followed, then the ladder came
slowly down, and the Southerner descended,
while Virgie crouched, a sobbing little heap,
beside her doll. But when he reached the bottom
rung, she rose to her feet and ran to meet
him, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Daddy, Daddy, I didn't do it right!
I didn't do it right!&quot;</p>

<p>She buried her head in his tattered coat,
while he slipped an arm about her and tried
to soothe a sorrow too great for such a tiny
heart to bear.</p>

<p>&quot;But you did do it right,&quot; he told her. &quot;It
was my fault. Mine! My leg got cramped,
and I had to move.&quot; He stooped and kissed
her. &quot;It was <i>my</i> fault, honey; but you?&mdash;you
did it <i>splendidly</i>!&quot; He patted her tear-stained
cheek, then turned to his captor, with
a grim, hard smile of resignation to his fate.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Colonel, you've had a long chase of it;
but you've gotten my brush at last.&quot;</p>

<p>The Union soldier faced him, speaking
earnestly:</p>

<p>&quot;Captain Cary, you're a brave man&mdash;and
one of the best scouts in the Confederate army.
I regret this happening&mdash;more than I can
say.&quot; The Southerner shrugged his shoulders.
His Northern captor asked: &quot;Are you carrying
dispatches?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Any other papers?&mdash;of any kind?&quot; No
answer came, and he added sternly: &quot;It
is quite useless to refuse. Give them to
me.&quot;</p>

<p>He held out his hand, but his captive only
looked him in the eyes; and the answer, though
spoken in an undertone, held a world of quiet
meaning:</p>

<p>&quot;You can take it&mdash;<i>afterwards</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>The Federal officer bit his lip; and yet he
could not, would not, be denied. His request
became demand, backed by authority and the
right of might, till Virgie broke in, in a piping
voice of indignation:</p>

<p>&quot;You can't have it! It's mine! My pass
to Richmon'&mdash;from Gen'ral Lee.&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison turned slowly from the little rebel
to the man.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this true?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>The Southerner flushed, and for reply produced
the rumpled paper from his boot leg,
and handed it over without a word. The
Northerner read it carefully.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<i>Pass Virginia Cary and escort through all Confederate
lines and give safe-conduct wherever possible.</i></p>

<p>&quot;R.E. LEE, <i>General</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The reader crushed the paper in his fist,
while his hand sank slowly to his side, then he
raised his head and asked, in a voice which
was strangely out of keeping with a Lieutenant-Colonel
of the Union Cavalry:</p>

<p>&quot;And who was to be her escort? You?&quot;</p>

<p>The captive nodded, smiling his sad, grim
smile; and the captor swallowed hard as he
moved to the cabin door and stood listening
to the muttered rumble of the river guns.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Cary,&quot; he whispered brokenly;
&quot;more sorry than you can understand.&quot;</p>

<p>For a long time no one spoke, then the
Southerner went to Virgie, dropping his hand
in tenderness on her tumbled hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Just go into your room, honey; I want to
talk to Colonel Morrison.&quot; She looked up at
him doubtfully; but he added, with a reassuring
smile: &quot;It's all right, darling. I'll call you
in just a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>Still Virgie seemed to hesitate. She shifted
her doubting eyes toward the Union officer,
turned, and obeyed in silence, closing the door
of the adjoining room behind her. Then the
two men faced each other, without the hampering
presence of the child, each conscious of
the coming tragedy that both, till now, had
striven manfully to hide. The one moved
forward toward a seat, staggering as he
walked, and catching himself on the table's
edge, while the other's hand went out to lend
him aid; but the Southerner waved him
off.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, as he sank into a
chair. &quot;I don't <i>want</i> help&mdash;from <i>you</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Morrison.</p>

<p>&quot;Because,&quot; said Cary, in sullen anger, &quot;I
don't ask quarter, nor aid, from a man who
frightens children.&quot;</p>

<p>The Northerner's chin went up; and when
he replied his voice was trembling; not in passion,
but with a deeper, finer something which
had gripped his admiration for the courage
of a child:</p>

<p>&quot;And I wouldn't hurt a hair of her splendid
little head!&quot; He paused, then spoke again,
more calmly: &quot;You thought me a beast to
frighten her; but don't you know it was the
only thing to do? Otherwise my men might
have had to shoot you&mdash;before her eyes.&quot;
Cary made no answer, though now he understood;
and Morrison went on: &quot;It isn't easy
for me to track a fellow creature down; to take
him when he's wounded, practically unarmed,
and turn him over to a firing squad. But it's
war, my friend&mdash;one of the merciless realities
of war&mdash;and you ought to know the meaning
of its name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; returned the Southerner,
with all the pent-up bitterness of a hopeless
struggle and defeat; &quot;it has taken three years
to teach me&mdash;<i>and I know</i>! Look at me!&quot; he
cried, as he stood up in his rags and spread
his arms. &quot;Look at my country, swept as
bare as a stubble field! You've whipped us,
maybe, with your millions of money and your
endless men, and now you are warring with
the women and the children!&quot; He turned his
back and spoke in the deep intensity of scorn:
&quot;A fine thing, Colonel! And may you get
your ... reward!&quot;</p>

<p>The Northerner set his lips in a thin, cold
line; but curbed his wrath and answered the
accusation quietly:</p>

<p>&quot;There are two sides to the question, Cary;
<i>but there must be one flag</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then fly your flag in justice!&quot; the Southerner
retorted hotly, wheeling on his enemy,
with blazing eyes and with hands that shook in
the stress of passion. &quot;A while ago you called
me a brave man and a good scout; and, because
I'm both, your people have set a price on me.
Five hundred dollars&mdash;alive or dead!&quot; He
laughed; a hoarse, harsh travesty of mirth, and
added, with a lip that curled in withering
contempt: &quot;Alive or dead! A gentleman
and a scout!&mdash;for just half the price of one
good, sound nigger! By Heaven, it makes me
proud!&quot;</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison looked across
the table at his prisoner, and answered gravely,
yet with a touch of sternness in his military
tone:</p>

<p>&quot;You are more than a scout, Cary. You've
carried dispatches, and intercepted ours; for
both of which, if taken, you would have been
a prisoner of war, no more. But you've entered
our lines&mdash;not in a uniform of gray, <i>but
blue</i>&mdash;and you've cost us the loss of two important
battles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And had you done the same,&quot; returned the
Southerner, &quot;for you it would have meant promotion.
I've served my cause as best I could;
in the saddle or the rifle pit; in the woods, or
creeping through your lines. If I've cost you
a battle, my life is a puny price to pay, and
I'd pay it without a sigh.&quot; He paused and
sank into his seat. &quot;For myself, I don't care
much. I'm worn out, anyway; and I only
wanted to get my little girl to Richmond.&quot;
At the thought of Virgie his anger returned
to him, and he once more staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>&quot;But you,&quot; he accused, &quot;you've beaten a baby
by the force of arms! You've run me to earth&mdash;and
you've blocked her chance! It's Virgie
you are fighting now&mdash;not me&mdash;yes, just
as if you rode her down with a troop of horse!
A fine thing, Colonel! For you, a brevet!
For me, a firing squad! Well, call in your
men and get it over!&quot; Again he smiled; a
grim, slow smile of bitterness and scorn.
&quot;Bravo, Colonel Morrison! Bravo! You
add one other glory to your conquering sword&mdash;and,
besides, you'll receive five hundred dollars
in reward!&quot;</p>

<p>The Northerner turned upon him fiercely,
goaded at last to the breaking-point in a struggle
as black and awful as the struggle of his
brother-foe.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop it, man!&quot; he cried. &quot;I order you to
stop! It's duty!&mdash;not a miserable reward!&quot;
His cheeks were flaming; his muscles quivered,
and his fists were clenched. &quot;Do you
actually suppose,&quot; he asked, &quot;that I'm
proud of this? Do you think I'm wringing
blood out of your heart and mine&mdash;for
money?&quot;</p>

<p>They faced each other, two crouching,
snarling animals, the raw, primeval passions
of their hearts released, each seeing through
a mist of red; a mist that had risen up to roll
across a mighty land and plunge its noblest
sons into a bloody ruck of war.</p>

<p>They faced each other, silently; then slowly
the features of the Southerner relaxed. His
bitterness was laid aside. He spoke, in the
soft, slow accent of his people&mdash;an accent so
impossible to a trick of print or pen.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad you feel that way; and maybe,
after all, you're doing what you think is right.
Yes&mdash;and I know it's hard.&quot; He stopped,
then stepped a little nearer, timidly, as Virgie
might have done. &quot;Colonel,&quot; he said,
scarce audibly, &quot;I ask you just one thing; not
for myself, but for her&mdash;for Virgie. Get the
poor little tad through your lines, will you?&mdash;and&mdash;and
don't let her know&mdash;about
<i>me</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>His captor did not answer him in words, because
of the pain that took him by the throat;
but his hand went out, till it reached another
hand that gripped it gratefully.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Morrison,&quot; said the prisoner
simply. &quot;If it wasn't war times&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He choked, and said no more; yet silence
proved more eloquent than human speech.
They were men&mdash;brave men&mdash;and both were
grateful; the one, because an enemy would
keep his unspoken word; the other, because
a doomed man understood.</p>

<p>Cary opened the door of his daughter's
room and called to her. She came in quickly,
a question in her big brown eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; she said, &quot;you talked a mighty
long time. It was a heap more than jus' a
minute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was it?&quot; he asked, and forced a smile.
&quot;Well, you see, we had a lot to say.&quot; He
seated himself and, drawing her between his
knees, took both her hands. &quot;Now listen,
honey; I'm going away with this gentleman,
and&mdash;&quot; He stopped as she looked up doubtfully;
then added a dash of gayety to his tender
tone: &quot;Oh, but he <i>invited</i> me. And think!
He's coming back for <i>you</i>&mdash;to-day&mdash;to send
you up to Richmond. Now, isn't that just
fine?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie looked slowly from her father to the
Union soldier, who stood with downcast eyes,
his back to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; she whispered, &quot;he's a right good
Yankee&mdash;isn't he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; her father murmured sadly,
and in yearning love for the baby he must
leave behind; &quot;yes&mdash;he's mighty good!&quot;</p>

<p>He knelt and folded her in his arms, kissing
her, over and over, while his hand went fluttering
about her soft brown throat; then he
wrenched himself away, but stood for a lingering
instant more, his hands outstretched,
atremble for a last and lingering touch, his
heart a racing protest at the parting he must
speak.</p>

<p>&quot;Cary!&quot;</p>

<p>It was Morrison who spoke, in mercy for
the man; and once more Cary understood.
He turned to cross the broken door; to face a
firing squad in the hot, brown woods; to cross
the gulf which stretched beyond the rumble
of the guns and the snarling lip of war. But
even as he turned, a baby's voice called out, in
cheerful parting, which he himself had failed
to speak:</p>

<p>&quot;Good-by, Daddy-man. I'll see you up in
Richmon'.&quot;</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met and held, in
the hardest moment of it all; for well they
knew this hopeful prophecy could never be
fulfilled. Morrison sighed and moved toward
the door; but, from its threshold, he could see
his troopers returning at a trot across the
fields.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; he said to Cary; &quot;I'd rather my
men shouldn't know I've talked with you.&quot;
He pointed to the scuttle in the ceiling.
&quot;Would you mind if I asked you to
go back again? Hurry! They are coming.&quot;</p>

<p>The captured scout saluted, crossed to the
ladder, and began to mount. At the top he
paused to smile and blow a kiss to Virgie, then
disappeared, drew up the ladder after him,
and closed the trap.</p>

<p>The captor stood in silence, waiting for his
men; yet, while he stood, the little rebel pattered
to his side, slipping her hand in his confidingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Yankee,&quot; she asked, and looked up
into his face, &quot;are you goin' to let Daddy come
to Richmon', too?&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison withdrew his hand from hers&mdash;withdrew
it sharply&mdash;flung himself into a seat
beside the table, and began to scribble on the
back of Virgie's rumpled pass; while the child
stood watching, trusting, with the simple trust
of her little mother-heart.</p>

<p>In a moment or two, the troopers came
hurrying in, with Corporal Dudley in the lead.
He stood at attention, saluted his superior,
and made his report of failure in the search.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing sir. No tracks around the
spring, and no traces of the fellow anywhere;
but&mdash;&quot; He stopped. His keen eyes marked
the changed position of the table and followed
upward. He saw the outlines of the scuttle
above his head, and smiled. &quot;But I'm glad
to see that you've had better luck yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Corporal,&quot; said Morrison, with a
sharp return of his military tone, &quot;I think
I've found the fox's hole at last.&quot; He rose
and gave his orders briskly. &quot;Push that table
forward!&mdash;there!&mdash;below the trap! Two of
you get on it!&quot; He turned to the Corporal,
while he himself climbed up and stood beside
his men. &quot;Light that candle and pass it up
to me!&quot; The orders were obeyed. &quot;Now,
boys, boost me!&mdash;and we'll have him out.&quot;</p>

<p>They raised him, till he pushed the trap
aside and thrust his head and shoulders
through the opening. From below they could
see him as he waved the lighted candle to and
fro, and presently they heard his voice, that
sounded deep and muffled in the shallow loft:</p>

<p>&quot;All right, boys! You can let me down.&quot;</p>

<p>He slid to the table and sprang lightly to
the floor, facing his troopers with a smile, half-humorous,
half in seeming disappointment, as
he glanced at Virgie.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid the little rebel's right again.
<i>He isn't there!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Virgie, then clapped her hands
across her mouth, while the troopers slowly
looked from her into the level eyes of their
commanding officer. He stood before them,
straight and tall, a soldier, every inch of him;
and they knew that Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison
was lying like a gentleman. They knew
that their chief was staking the name and title
of an honorable soldier against the higher,
grander title of &quot;a man.&quot;</p>

<p>Only Corporal Dudley stood disconcerted
at the startling statement, but as there was
no help for it he could only strangle an oath
and give the order to pass out.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>'Tention! Right face! Forward! March!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>They mounted and rode a rod or two away,
awaiting orders; while Morrison stood silently
and watched them go. He, too&mdash;like Virgie&mdash;had
wrestled with a problem, and it stirred
him to the depths. As a trooper must obey,
so also must an officer obey a higher will; yes,
even as a slave in iron manacles. The master
of war had made his laws; and a servant broke
them, knowingly. A captured scout was a
prisoner, no more; a spy must hang, or fall before
the volley of a firing squad. No matter
for his bravery; no matter for the faithful
service to his cause, the man must die! The
glory was for another; for one who waved a
flag on the spine of a bloody trench; a trench
which his brothers stormed&mdash;and gave the
blood. No matter that a spy had made this
triumph possible. He had worn a uniform
which was not his own&mdash;and the dog must die!</p>

<p>So ruled the god of warfare; still, did war
prescribe disgrace and death for all? If Cary
had crept through the Union lines, to reach the
side of a helpless little one&mdash;<i>yes, even in a
coat of blue</i>&mdash;would the Great Tribunal count
his deed accursed? Should fearless human
love reap no reward beyond the crashing epitaph
of a firing squad, and the powder smoke
that drifted with the passing of a soul?</p>

<p>&quot;No! No!&quot; breathed Morrison. &quot;In God's
name, give the man his chance!&quot;</p>

<p>He straightened his back and smiled. He
took from the table a rumpled paper and
turned to the littlest factor in the great Rebellion.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, Virgie! Here's your pass to Richmond&mdash;for
you and your escort&mdash;through the
Federal lines.&quot;</p>

<p>She came to him slowly, wondering; her tiny
body quivering with suppressed excitement,
her voice a whispering caress:</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean for&mdash;for Daddy, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you little rebel!&quot; he answered, choking
as he laughed; &quot;but I'm terribly afraid
you'll have to pay me&mdash;with a kiss.&quot;</p>

<p>She sprang into his waiting arms, and kissed
him as he raised her up; but when he would
have set her down, her little brown hands, with
their berry-stained fingers, clung tightly about
his neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait! Wait!&quot; she cried. &quot;Here's another
one&mdash;for Gertrude! Tell her it's from
Virgie! An' tell her I sent it, 'cause her
daddy is jus' the best damn Yankee that ever
was!&quot;</p>

<p>The trap above had opened, and the head
and shoulders of the Southerner appeared;
while Morrison looked up and spoke in parting:</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right, Cary. I only ask a soldier's
pledge that you take your little girl to Richmond&mdash;nothing
more. In passing through
our lines, whatever you see or hear&mdash;<i>forget</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>A sacred trust it was, of man to man, one
brother to another; and Morrison knew that
Herbert Cary would pass through the very
center of the Federal lines, as a <i>father</i>, not a
spy.</p>

<p>The Southerner tried to speak his gratitude,
but the words refused to come; so he stretched
one trembling hand toward his enemy of war,
and eased his heart in a sobbing, broken call:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Morrison! Some day it will all&mdash;be over!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the cabin's doorway stood Virgie and
her father, hand in hand. They watched a
lonely swallow as it dipped across the desolate,
unfurrowed field. They listened to the distant
beat of many hoofs on the river road and
the far, faint clink of sabers on the riders'
thighs; and when the sounds were lost to the
listeners at last, the notes of a bugle came
whispering back to them, floating, dipping,
even as the swallow dipped across the unfurrowed
fields.</p>

<p>But still the two stood lingering in the doorway,
hand in hand. The muddy James took
up his murmuring song again; the locusts
chanted in the hot, brown woods to the basso
growl of the big, black guns far down the
river.</p>

<p>A sad, sad song it was; yet on its echoes
seemed to ride a haunting, hopeful memory
of the rebel's broken call, &quot;Some day it will
all be over!&quot;</p>

<p>And so the guns growled on, slow, sullen,
thundering forth the battle-call of a still unconquered
enmity; but only that peace might
walk &quot;some day&quot; in the path of the shrieking
shells.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>It was afternoon and over on the eastern side
of the James where the old Turnpike leads up
over the rolling hills to Richmond the sun was
pouring down a flood of heat. The 'pike was
ankle deep with dust and the fine, white powder,
churned into floury softness by artillery
and the myriad iron heels of war, had settled
down on roadside bush and tree and vine till
all the sweet green of summer hung its head
under the hot weight and longed for a cooling
shower which would wash it clean.</p>

<p>In fairer times the Pike had been an active
thoroughfare for the plantations and hundreds
of smaller truck farms which fed the capitol,
but of late months nearly all this traffic had
disappeared. For the days of the Confederacy
were drawing slowly but none the less
surely to a close.</p>

<p>Inside the breastworks and far flung fortifications
which encompassed Richmond the
flower of the rebel arms, the Army of Northern
Virginia, lay like a rat caught in a trap.
On three sides, north, east and south the Army
of the Potomac under Grant beleaguered the
city while the tireless Sheridan, with that
lately developed arm of the Federals, the cavalry,
raided right and left and struck hard
blows at the crumbling cause where they were
least expected. Yet in this same dark hour
there had been a ray of light. Once the Confederacy
had come within hairbreadth of overwhelming
success, for Early's hard riding
troopers had made a dash for Washington
but a few weeks before and, with the prize
almost in their grasp, had only been turned
back by a great force which the grim, watchful
Grant suddenly threw in between their
guns and the gleaming dome of the nation's
capitol.</p>

<p>But even this small success was not for long
for when Early, crossing over into the luscious
valley of the Shenandoah, began to scourge
it with his hosts and threaten a raid into Pennsylvania,
Sheridan broke loose from the restriction
of telegraph wires and followed him
to the death and finally broke the back of the
great raid with his mad gallop from Winchester.</p>

<p>Meanwhile around Richmond, Lee and
Grant, a circle within a circle, were constantly
feeling each other out, shifting their troops
from point to point in attack and defense,&mdash;for
all the world like two fighting dogs hunting
for an opening in the fence. And all the
time the grim, quiet man in blue kept contracting
his lines around the wonderful tactician
in gray until the whole world came to
know that unless Lee could break through the
gap to the southwest the end of the war was
plainly in sight.</p>

<p>And so it happened that on this hot July
day the only sign of life on the 'pike was a
small cloud of dust which drifted lazily in the
wake of two people who passed along the road
on foot.</p>

<p>One of the two was a tired, gaunt man in
a ragged uniform of gray who stared up the
long, hot road ahead of him with eyes in which
there was, in spite of every discouragement
the light of a certain firm resolve.</p>

<p>The other of the two was a child with bare,
brown legs and tattered gingham dress who
limped painfully along beside the man, her
sunny hair in a tangle half across her pinched
and weary little face.</p>

<p>At a faint sigh of exhaustion from the child
the man looked down, gathered her up in his
arms and perched her on his shoulder. Then
he plodded on again, a prey to weariness and
hunger. The turning point in Herbert
Cary's life had come. Thanks to a generous
enemy; Virgie and he were now reasonably
sure of food if once they could reach the Confederate
lines but as for himself, with the
woman he had loved asleep forever beneath
the pines, the future could only be an unending,
barren stretch of gray.</p>

<p>Then, almost as quickly, recollection of his
duty towards her whom he carried in his arms
came to him and he raged at himself for his
moment of selfish discouragement. Spurred
on by the necessity of gaining a point of
safety for his child he began to calculate the
distance yet to be covered and their chances of
gaining friendly lines before encountering
scouting parties of Federals. Behind him, a
few miles south on the other bank of the James
at Light House Point Sheridan was in camp
with two brigades and Cary knew this fast
riding, hard striking cavalryman too well not
to suspect that the country, even in front of
him, was alive with Union men. There was
the pass which Morrison had given him, of
course, but the worth of a pass in war time
often depends more on him who receives it
than on the signature.</p>

<p>But all those things, even food, would have
to wait for a while because he was consumed
with thirst and must find water before he went
another mile forward.</p>

<p>A tired sigh from Virgie caught his ear and
he stopped by a stone wall and let her get
down from his shoulder. The child stood up
on the broad, flat stones and then gave a little
cry of pain. She raised one foot up and
nursed it against her dusty, brown leg, meanwhile
clutching her doll closer to her neck.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right, honey; be a brave little girl,&quot;
her father said consolingly. &quot;There's a
spring along here somewhere and we can look
after that poor little foot. Ah, there it is,&quot;
he cried, as he caught sight of a big rock behind
a stone wall with a seepage of water under
it among some trees at one side. &quot;Just sit
still a minute&mdash;till I rest&mdash;and then we'll have
a look.&quot; He leaned back against the wall and
closed his eyes to shut out the dizziness with
which exhaustion and hunger filled his aching
head.</p>

<p>The child watched him anxiously for a moment
and then put a soft little hand on his
shoulder:</p>

<p>&quot;Are you <i>so</i> tired, Daddy-man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; he answered with a faint smile
as he opened his eyes. &quot;I had to catch my
breath, but I'm really all right. Now then,
we'll call in the hospital corps.&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie slipped down and sat on the top of
the wall with her foot in her hand, rocking to
and fro, but bravely saying nothing until her
father's eye caught the look of pain on her
pinched face.</p>

<p>&quot;Does it hurt you much, dear?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir. It&mdash;it hurts like the mischief,&quot;
answered Virgie in a small voice. &quot;It keeps
jumping up and down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Little woman, that's too bad,&quot; he said with
a consoling pat on the head which seemed to
take most of the pain away. &quot;But after we
bathe it and tie it up it will feel better.&quot;</p>

<p>Kneeling beside the spring he took off his
campaign hat of felt and dipped it full of
clear, cold water.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow!&quot; cried Virgie suddenly in the interval
and she slapped her leg with a resounding
whack. &quot;There are 'skeeters roun' this place.
One of 'em bit me&mdash;an old <i>he</i> one. Jiminy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he?&quot; asked her father, smiling as he
came back with the hat. &quot;Well, honey, there
are much worse things in this world than those
little fellows and if you don't complain any
more than that you're going to be a very happy
lady when you grow up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like Mamma?&quot; asked the little tot, with a
thoughtful face.</p>

<p>&quot;Just like Mamma,&quot; the man repeated.
&quot;The loveliest&mdash;the bravest&mdash;and the <i>best</i>.&quot;
He wavered a little on his feet and the hat
threatened to slip through his fingers, but his
daughter's great, dark eyes were steady on
his and, curiously enough, he seemed to draw
strength to pull himself together.</p>

<p>&quot;And now, let's see. We'll have to get the
grime off first. Just dip the little wounded
soldier in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! My foot in your hat!&quot; protested
Virgie with a little scream. &quot;Oh, you poor
daddy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, that's all right, honey,&quot; he laughed,
pleased at her daintiness. &quot;That hat's an old
veteran. He don't mind anything. So&mdash;souse
her in.</p>

<p>&quot;There&mdash;easy now&mdash;<i>easy</i>&quot; as she threatened
to capsize this curious basin. &quot;Big toe first.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know it's cold,&quot; he laughed as the
water stung the broken skin and made her
twitch involuntarily, &quot;but bathing will do it
good. I just know it feels better already&mdash;doesn't
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; answered Virgie meekly, &quot;only&mdash;it
jumps up and down harder than ever. But
of course I know it must be getting better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good! What did I tell you? Now let
Daddy look.&quot;</p>

<p>He lifted her foot up tenderly and examined
it with care. &quot;My, my!&quot; he murmured.
&quot;You poor little soldier. If I hadn't
looked around that time I expect you'd been
willing to walk all the way to Richmond on a
foot that would make a whole regiment
straggle. Just see where you've cut it&mdash;right
under the second little piggie. We'll have to
tie it right up and keep the bothersome old
dust from getting in. By morning you'll
hardly feel it.&quot;</p>

<p>With a soldier's readiness he opened his coat
and began to tear a strip from his shirt from
which to make a bandage. But his small
daughter interrupted him with a vigorous
protest.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; she cried, with a face full of alarm
at the willful destruction of his garment.
&quot;Don't do that. Here! You can take it
off my petticoat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>That</i> petticoat,&quot; her father laughed, with
the first real mirth she had heard for many
weeks. &quot;That poor little petticoat wouldn't
make an arm bandage for Susan Jemima.
Now&mdash;up with your hoofie and let's play I'm
a surgeon and you're a brave soldier who has
fought in every battle since we first made the
Yanks skedaddle at Bull Run.&quot;</p>

<p>With the painful foot securely bandaged
the little girl gave herself up to thought,
emerging from her study at last to ask what
was an all-important question.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you reckon, by the time the war is over,
we could call Susan Jemima a vet'ran?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should say we could,&quot; the father agreed
heartily, without the symptom of a smile.
&quot;Hasn't she grown bald in the service? And
hasn't she almost lost an arm&mdash;or is it a leg
I see dangling so terribly? I'll tell you what
we'll do! We'll give her an honorable discharge&mdash;and
decorate her. How's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, fine!&quot; she cried, clapping her hands
with delight at the fantasy. &quot;And we'll get
that Yankee man to write her a pass just like
mine. Do you hear that, Cap'n Susan,&quot; she
crooned to the doll, unconscious of the convulsion
of silent amusement beside her.
&quot;When we get to Richmon'&mdash;if we ever <i>do</i>
get there&mdash;I'm going to make you a uniform!&quot;</p>

<p>Then she turned to her father with a little
sigh, for the miles seemed very long.</p>

<p>&quot;How far <i>is</i> it to Richmon', Daddy-man?&quot;
she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Just about twelve miles,&quot; her father answered.
&quot;But they're real old country miles,
I'm sorry to say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can we get to it to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>The simple little question made the man's
heart ache. What wouldn't he give for an
hour of Roger once more&mdash;or Belle&mdash;or
Lightfoot! Anything&mdash;even one of the old
plantation mules would do if he could only
perch her up on its back and take her into
Richmond like a lady and not like the daughter
of poor white trash, tramping, poverty
stricken, along a dusty road.</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear, not to-night,&quot; he sighed. &quot;We've
come a long way and we're both tired. So
when it gets dark we'll curl up somewhere in
the nice, sweet woods and take a snooze, just
like camping out. And then&mdash;in the morning,
when the old sun comes sneaking up
through the trees, we'll fool him! We won't
wait till he can make it hot, but we'll get right
up with the birds and the squirrels and we'll
just run right along. And by twelve o'clock
we'll be in Richmond&mdash;where they have good
things to eat. So there you are&mdash;all mapped
out. Only now we'll have a belt supper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A belt supper?&quot; queried the child curiously,
though her face brightened at the
thought of <i>any</i> kind of supper, made out of
belts or any other thing.</p>

<p>&quot;Um-hum,&quot; asseverated her father gravely.
&quot;See&mdash;this is the way it's done.&quot;</p>

<p>He cupped his hands and took a draught
from the spring, pretending to chew it as it
went down. &quot;You take a big drink of nice
cold water; then draw up your belt as tight
as you can&mdash;and say your prayers.&quot;</p>

<p>To his surprise his small daughter only
sniffed scornfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, shucks, Daddy! I know a better way
than that. Susan an' me used to do it all
the time while you were away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you do?&quot; he asked curiously, for
he had forgotten that more than half the childish
play world is the world of &quot;make believe.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, we&mdash;we just '<i>let on</i>,'&quot; she answered,
with simple na&iuml;vet&eacute;. &quot;Sit down an' I'll show
you how.&quot;</p>

<p>He sat down obediently, but not before he
had picked up an old tin can from nearby
and set it carefully between them.</p>

<p>&quot;This rock is our table&mdash;the moss is the
table cloth. Oh, it isn't green,&quot; she cried as
he looked down in serious doubt. &quot;You
must <i>help</i> me make believe. Now&mdash;doesn't it
look nice and white?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It does, indeed. I can see nothing but
snowy linen of the finest texture,&quot; he responded
instantly.</p>

<p>&quot;That's better,&quot; complimented his hostess.
And then with a grand air&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so glad you dropped in, sir&mdash;an' just
at supper time. Pass your plate an' allow
me to help you to some batter bread.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Batter bread! Ah, just what I was
hoping for,&quot; her guest replied, thankfully extending
his plate for the imaginary feast.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you. Delicious. The very best I've
tasted for a year. Did you make it yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear, no&mdash;the cook.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, of course! Pray pardon me, I
might have known.&quot;</p>

<p>The little hostess inclined her head. &quot;Take
plenty of butter. 'Cause batter bread isn't
good 'thout butter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you&mdash;what lovely golden butter.
And&mdash;goodness gracious! What is this I
see before me? Can this really be a sausage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; laughed Virgie with delight.
&quot;And there's the ham. I smoked it myself
over hick'ry wood. Please help yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>She pretended to arrange a cup and saucer
in front of her and held daintily in her fingers
a pair of imaginary sugar tongs.</p>

<p>&quot;Coffee? How many lumps? And <i>do</i>
you take cream?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Five, please&mdash;and a little cream. There&mdash;just
right.&quot;</p>

<p>She passed the cup gracefully and added
a little moue of concern for the efficiency of
her m&eacute;nage.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid you won't find it very hot,&quot; said
this surprising young hostess. &quot;That butler
of mine is growing absolutely <i>wuthless</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then perhaps we can have something better,&quot;
her guest responded readily, and he
picked up the battered old tin can. &quot;Permit
me, Miss Cary, to offer you a glass of fine old
blackberry wine which I carefully brought
with me to your beautiful home. It has been
in my family wine cellars since 1838.</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;&quot; he cried, as Virgie suddenly sat
back with a look of painful recollection on her
face.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Daddy,&quot; she murmured pathetically,
&quot;<i>don't</i> let's call it <i>blackberry</i> wine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive me, darling,&quot; her father said tenderly,
and he took the small face between his
hands and kissed her. &quot;There, now&mdash;it's all
right. It's <i>all right</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>To create a diversion he looked behind him
with a frown and spoke with great severity to
an imaginary waiter.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, <i>Jo</i>! How dare you bring such terribly
reminiscent stuff to our table. Go get the
port.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll surely have to discharge that butler,&quot;
he said. &quot;He's too shiftless. And now, fair
lady, will you honor me by joining the humblest
of your admirers in a sip of port.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With pleasure,&quot; answered his hostess, and
lifted the can of water in both hands. &quot;Your
health, sir. May your shadow never grow
littler.&quot;</p>

<p>Half way through her drink Virgie stopped
and slowly put the can down. She looked at
her father, who already had his finger at his
lips. Voices had come to them from down
the road&mdash;the sounds of a party of men talking
and laughing as they marched along.</p>

<p>Cary's face took on again the grim lines
which had been wiped away momentarily by
their little bit of play. He was trying to
make himself believe that the approaching
party might be friends, although he knew
only too well that such a possibility was full
of doubt. There were too many scouting
parties of Federals ready to pounce on Rebel
patrols in these perilous days to allow any but
large forces of men to venture far from
Richmond, and when his own men sallied
forth they did not go with laughter but with
tightly drawn, silent lips.</p>

<p>&quot;S-s-s-h,&quot; he whispered, and held up his
finger again, as she seemed ready to burst into
questioning.</p>

<p>Immediately she snuggled close to him and
whispered hotly in his ear, &quot;Who are they,
Daddy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know, honey,&quot; he whispered back.
&quot;But I'm afraid they're Yanks. Keep quiet
till they pass.&quot; And quickly deserting the
stone under the trees where they had had their
&quot;belt supper&quot; he drew her with him behind
the large ledge of rock from under which the
spring flowed out. Looking behind them he
saw that with good luck they could reach the
shelter of the woods and get up over the hill
without being seen. But just now they could
not stir from their hiding place unless&mdash;unless
the men were Confederates. This faint hope,
however, soon flickered out when he saw the
color of their uniforms.</p>

<p>Up the road came four dismounted men
with a corporal in command. They were
taking it easy as they walked along, their caps
thrust back, their coats open and their Sharps'
carbines carried in the variety of ways that a
soldier adopts to ease his shoulder of the burden
that grows heavier with every mile.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's the place, boys,&quot; the Corporal
called out as his eye fell on the spring. &quot;We
can get some decent water, now. That James
River water's too yellow for any white man
to put inside of him.&quot;</p>

<p>At the sound of a voice which he had heard
that same morning while he hid in the attic
of the overseer's cabin Cary's hold on his
daughter's hand tightened warningly.</p>

<p>&quot;Come along, Virgie,&quot; he whispered.
&quot;We'll get out of the way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Daddy,&quot; she protested in low tones,
&quot;we've got our pass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I know,&quot; he answered, with a
twinge of regret that the rest of the world
could not trust so faithfully to human kindness.
&quot;But that's for emergency. Come
along, honey&mdash;quick!&quot;</p>

<p>Silently as a shadow the two stole out of
the shelter of the ledge of rock, and by dint of
keeping it between them and the troopers,
managed to cover most of the open space between
the spring and the protecting trees without
being seen. Meanwhile, they heard the
Corporal giving his commands.</p>

<p>&quot;You, Collins, take sentry duty out there in
the road for a while. As soon as we make the
coffee we'll bring you out a cup. Now&mdash;over
the wall with you, men.&quot;</p>

<p>Leaving one man behind to pace slowly up
and down the dusty road the four sprang over
the wall and advanced towards the spring. It
was well the sight of the cool water held their
eyes for if they had only looked up they
might have seen Virgie wresting her hand out
of her father's grasp and standing suddenly
petrified with the thought that she had left behind
her one beloved possession.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's the spring, Smith&mdash;under the rock.
Fill up the canteens. Here, Harry, help me
get fire wood.&quot;</p>

<p>With a soldier's readiness when it comes to
making camp one of the troopers promptly
collected the canteens and knelt down by the
spring, carefully submerging one at a time so
as to get the sweet, cold water in all its purity.
Another opened the knapsacks and took out a
can of coffee, biscuits and some scraps of meat&mdash;not
much with which to make a meal but still
so much more than many a Rebel soldier had
that day as to take on the proportions of a
feast. Meanwhile, Corporal Dudley had
drawn his saber and was engaged in leisurely
lopping off the dead branches of a fallen tree.</p>

<p>&quot;This strikes me a lot better than the camp,&quot;
he remarked as he tossed his firewood into a
heap. &quot;A man and his friends can have a
quiet drink here, without treating a whole
battalion.&quot;</p>

<p>His eye fell on the ground near the spring
as he spoke and he paused. Then, with a grin
on his face, he jabbed his saber into something
which lay there and held it transfixed on the
point.</p>

<p>&quot;Say, boys&mdash;look at this,&quot; and he shook
poor Susan Jemima till her arms and legs
wiggled spasmodically and her dress seemed
on the point of complete disintegration.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if Corporal Dudley had not
laughed derisively Virgie might have stayed
hidden in the protection of the trees, but this
outrageous insult combined with the terrible
sight of poor Susan Jemima impaled on a
Yankee sword was too much for her bursting
heart. With blazing eyes she broke away
from her father and dashed back to the group
at the spring.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, you! You stop that,&quot; she cried
angrily at the astonished troopers, who caught
up their carbines at the sound of feet. &quot;<i>How
dare you!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>There was a moment of surprise and then
the four broke out in guffaws of laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, hang me if it isn't the little girl we
saw this morning,&quot; shouted Dudley, without,
however, stopping the torture of the defenseless
Susan Jemima. &quot;Where did <i>you</i> drop from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ne'm min' where I dropped from,&quot; commanded
the wrathful Virgie with her dark
eyes like twin stars of hate. &quot;You're the
meanest old thing I ever saw. <i>Give me back
my baby!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Back in the trees a little way a man was
watching with a heavy heart. He knew only
too well what was to come. No matter what
the final outcome might be when he showed
his safe-guard to his own army's lines there
would be a delay and searching questions and
more of the old insults which always made his
blood boil&mdash;which always made the increasing
burden of despair still harder to bear. But
there was no use in putting off the trial&mdash;Virgie
had slipped away in spite of every
whispered remonstrance and now that she was
there in the center of that group of guffawing
Yankees, there, too, was the only place for
him. And so, he stepped out swiftly and
faced the enemy.</p>

<p>&quot;Hah!&quot; shouted Dudley, looking up at the
sound of branches crackling underfoot. &quot;A
Johnnie Reb, eh&mdash;walking right into camp!
That's right, Harry, keep him covered.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked Cary over from head to foot with
a sneer at his tattered uniform.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; he asked, &quot;who are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Confederate officer,&quot; was the quiet reply,
&quot;acting as escort for this child. We are
on our way to Richmond.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary's hand went into the breast of his coat
and he drew out a folded paper.</p>

<p>&quot;Here is my authority for entering your
lines&mdash;a pass signed by Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrison.&quot;</p>

<p>At the sound of the name Corporal Dudley
started and quickly took the paper. But before
he opened it he gave Cary a keen look
which, to the Confederate officer, did not bode
well for the prospect of immediate release. It
seemed as if the man's sharp wits had suddenly
seized on something which he could profitably
turn to his own account.</p>

<p>With his back turned on Cary and Virgie
the Corporal unfolded the pass and studied it
carefully, while the troopers gathered behind
him and tried to read its contents over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Pwhat does it say?&quot; asked the young Irishman,
Harry O'Connell, who had covered Cary
with his carbine. &quot;'Tis a precious bit of paper,
bedad&mdash;if it passes him through <i>me</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It says: 'Pass Virginia Cary and escort
through all Federal lines, and assist them as
far as possible in reaching Richmond,'&quot; read
the Corporal.</p>

<p>Deep in thought he turned the paper over
and studied the name on the back. At the
sight of the signature there his mouth fell
open and he uttered a shout of surprise. His
eyes brightened and he stepped back from the
group and threw up his head with a look of
triumph on his dark face. He struck the paper
a slap with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Morrison on <i>one</i> side&mdash;and 'Old Bob' on
the <i>other</i>&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;What luck! What
a <i>find</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How so&mdash;a find?&quot;</p>

<p>The man who had had to put his own brother
under arrest a few short weeks before and then
had seen him shot through the heart by this
same officer whose name was on the pass
looked at the questioner with an ugly glitter
in his eyes. He was beginning to taste already
the sweets of revenge. For blood ties
bind, no matter how badly they are stretched,
and long ago Corporal Dudley had sworn to
wipe out his grudge.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, man, can't you see?&quot; he whispered
excitedly. &quot;This Johnnie Reb is the man that
was hiding in the cabin loft this morning.
Morrison lied when he said he wasn't there&mdash;you
remember, he was the only one who
looked&mdash;he lied and as soon as he got us out of
the way he let him come down and he gave
him <i>this</i>. Could any man ask for better proof
that we had the spy right in our hands and
then our commanding officer deliberately let
him go?&quot;</p>

<p>At the sound of the man's excited whispering
Cary's fears as to the value of Virgie's
pass grew too strong to warrant this agony
of watching and waiting, and he stepped forward
with a sharp question:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Corporal, isn't the pass satisfactory?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, perfectly&mdash;perfectly,&quot; Dudley answered
with baleful readiness, but made no
move to return it.</p>

<p>Cary put out his hand. &quot;Then I would like
to have it again, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p>By way of answer Corporal Dudley carefully
found an inside pocket and buttoned the
pass up in his coat. &quot;Oh, no, you don't,&quot; he
said, with an evil grin. &quot;I've got a better use
for that little piece of paper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean that you're my prisoner, Mister
Johnnie Reb,&quot; was the brutal answer.</p>

<p>&quot;For what?&quot; asked Cary, while his heart
grew sick inside him and his lips twitched.
Richmond&mdash;and food for Virgie were growing
farther away every moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Because you're a Rebel <i>spy</i>, that's why,&quot;
came the biting answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh&mdash;none of that,&quot; as Cary's fists doubled
up and he made a forward step at the Corporal.
&quot;I guess you know what's good for
you, with three guns at your back. If Colonel
Morrison wouldn't take you as a spy, <i>I
will!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here, boys,&quot; he said in brusque command
to his men, &quot;we'll have to cut the supper and
take this man to camp. There'll be a sunrise
hanging to-morrow or I miss my guess.
Come on, now. Bring him along.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute, Corporal,&quot; O'Connell
said. &quot;Sure I've something to say to ye,&quot; and
he led him aside where the others could not
bear.</p>

<p>All unconscious of the fatal predicament
into which Susan Jemima and she had got
them Virgie looked up at her father from
where she stood in the shelter of his arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; she questioned, in a small, puzzled
voice, &quot;what are they going to do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;S-s-s-h,&quot; her father commanded as he
patted her head comfortingly. &quot;Everything
will be all right, honey, I'm sure.&quot; But he
had caught enough of the Corporal's altercation
with Trooper O'Connell to make him see
that things were very far from being what he
wanted Virgie to suppose.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye'd better be careful now,&quot; O'Connell
said to Dudley. &quot;Ye know well that if the
pass is all right ye'll be getting yerself into a
peck o' trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't <i>me</i> that'll get in trouble,&quot; Dudley
answered, with grim triumph. &quot;It's someone
else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Faith, then, <i>who</i>?&quot; was the query.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Morrison</i>,&quot; snapped Dudley, with an
ominous click of his teeth.</p>

<p>&quot;The Colonel? Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Because he helped this spy escape!</i> that's
why. He killed my brother, shot him. Shot
him down like a dog. But now I'm even with
him.&quot;</p>

<p>He shook the pass under the trooper's nose
and crowed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&quot;I've been waiting for a chance like this,&quot; he
chortled, &quot;and now I'm going to make him
sweat&mdash;sweat blood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be a fool, Corporal,&quot; the trooper
counseled. &quot;What'll ye be after doin'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Report him, at headquarters</i>&mdash;for helping
a spy escape! If I have the man and <i>this</i>,&quot;
and he slapped the paper, &quot;it'll mean his sword
and shoulder straps&mdash;if not a bullet! Come
on!&quot;</p>

<p>He turned away, to scramble over the wall,
but Trooper O'Connell caught his arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on! Ye may get in trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>In answer Dudley broke away and doggedly
kept on towards the stone wall and the
road. &quot;Keep off,&quot; he snarled. &quot;<i>I'm</i> running
this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know ye are,&quot; the trooper replied, &quot;but
wait,&quot; and he pointed to the rear. &quot;Don't
forgit that the Colonel's out yonder reconnoiterin'.
If he happened to overtake ye on
the road&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Struck with the sudden thought Dudley
paused. &quot;Well, that's so,&quot; he growled as he
saw how easily he could be held for disobeying
orders and how quickly all his plans for
vengeance could be smashed. He stood still
for a moment gnawing his lip, then suddenly
struck his doubled fist into the palm of the
other hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Then you stay here to guard the prisoner,&quot;
he said. &quot;I'll cut through the woods&mdash;make
my report&mdash;come back with the horses&mdash;and
my authority.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here, Smith! You and Judson come
along with me. Never mind the grub. We'll
get that later.&quot;</p>

<p>Turning to O'Connell, &quot;If you hear anyone
coming, take those two into the woods. Collins!
You'll have to stay on sentry duty till
I get back. If any troops pass here, get out
of sight at once and give Harry warning.
Now, boys&mdash;come along with me&mdash;we'll take
it on the trot,&quot; and climbing quickly over the
wall the man who held two lives in the hollow
of his hand ran down the road with the two
troopers, finally cutting over into the woods
and disappearing from view.</p>

<p>Gary and Virgie stood still by the spring.
Out in the road the sentry paced back and
forth. Behind them Trooper O'Connell stood
on guard, his carbine in his arms across his
breast.</p>

<p>Virgie pulled gently at her father's hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; she whispered, &quot;are they&mdash;are
they goin' to carry us off to the Yankee
camp?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid so, darling, but I don't know,&quot;
he answered sadly. &quot;We'll just have to wait.
Wait,&quot; he repeated, as he sat down on a rock
and drew her close to him. Without being
seen either by Virgie or O'Connell he picked
up a jagged stone the size of his fist and hid
it under his knee against the rock. It would
be a poor weapon at best, but Cary had grown
desperate and if the trooper once turned his
back and gave him opportunity poor Harry
O'Connell would wake up with a very bad
headache and Virgie would be in Richmond.</p>

<p>But Virgie's eyes were on neither the hidden
stone nor her father's watchful, relentless face.
All that Virgie could see was a knapsack open
on the ground and food&mdash;real food displayed
round about with a prodigality which made
her mouth water and her eyes as big as saucers.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; she murmured, clutching at his
sleeve, &quot;while we are waitin' do you reckon we
could take just a <i>little</i> bit of that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear&mdash;not now,&quot; her father answered,
with a touch of impatience. It would be too
much, even in those bitter times, to accept a
man's food and then break his head for it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Virgie, completely mystified
at the restraint, &quot;I don't see why they
shouldn't be polite to us. We were just as
polite as could be when the Yankees took our
corn.&quot;</p>

<p>Just then the young Irishman with the carbine
turned around and caught the wan look
on Virgie's face and the hunger appeal in her
big dark eyes. At once a broad smile broke
over his freckled countenance and he gestured
hospitably with his gun.</p>

<p>&quot;Have somethin' to eat, little wan.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary's knee loosened. The jagged stone
fell to the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, old fellow,&quot; he cried, springing
to his feet. &quot;I can't show my gratitude to
you in any substantial way at present&mdash;but
God bless you, just the same.&quot; He dropped
down on the rock again and hid his face in his
hands. Another moment and the kindhearted
trooper might have been lying face downwards
in the muddy ground around the spring.
It had been only touch-and-go, but the man's
warm Irish heart had saved him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's all right, sir,&quot; O'Connell answered
freely. &quot;Sure an' <i>I'd</i> like to see ye
get through, though I ain't the Gineral. At
least, not yet,&quot; he grinned.</p>

<p>&quot;There ye are, little girl,&quot; he went on, pushing
the knapsack over towards Virgie with the
muzzle of his carbine. &quot;Jist help yerself&mdash;an'
give yer dad some, too.&quot;</p>

<p>With a little cry of delight Virgie swooped
down on the knapsack and explored its interior
with eager hands.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm much obliged, Mr. Yankee. We
cert'ny do need it&mdash;bad.&quot; She tossed the
tangled hair back from her eyes and looked
thankfully up at this curious person who had
so much food that he could really give part of
it away. &quot;Please, Mr. Yankee&mdash;won't you
tell me your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Harry O'Connell, at your service, miss.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she bowed. &quot;I'm very glad
to meet you.&quot; Then her searching hands
found something wonderful in the knapsack
and she sprang up and ran with her prizes to
her father.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, Daddy&mdash;<i>two biscuits!</i> Take one.
It's&mdash;it's <i>real</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>Cary's eyes grew moist.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, darling. Thank you.&quot; Just
now the lump in his throat would not have allowed
him to eat soup, let alone a rather hard
biscuit, but he looked up with a laugh and
waved a genial salute to the trooper, who as
genially responded.</p>

<p>Virgie, however, had become quite single
minded since she had discovered food, and
with a happy sigh she raised the biscuit to her
lips. Just then the sentry in the road flung
up his hand with a shout.</p>

<p>&quot;Look out, O'Connell! They're coming,&quot;
and he clambered quickly over the wall and
dropped behind it, his gun in readiness.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; demanded the other trooper.</p>

<p>&quot;Detachment of cavalry. A small one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But whose is it, man. Can ye not see?&quot;</p>

<p>Collins, holding his hand behind him in a
gesture which commanded them to stay where
they were, raised his head cautiously over the
wall.</p>

<p>&quot;Morrison's,&quot; he answered, after a quick
look, and he dropped down again out of sight.</p>

<p>At the sound of hoof beats and the name
she remembered so well Virgie, with her biscuit
all untasted, sprang up from the ground as if
she would run out on the road. But her
father caught her, for O'Connell had turned to
them with a serious face.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, sir, but I'll have to trouble ye
to get under cover in the woods. No argymint,
sir,&quot; he said decisively, as he saw some
show of resistance on Cary's part. &quot;I'm under
orders.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I know,&quot; Cary cried, impatiently,
&quot;but I want to speak to Colonel Morrison.
I <i>must</i> speak to him. Give me a moment,
man. You won't ever regret it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come now&mdash;none o' that,&quot; commanded the
trooper, pushing him back with the carbine
across his breast. &quot;Don't make me use force,
sir. Ye'll have to go&mdash;so go quietly. And
mind&mdash;no shenanigan!&quot;</p>

<p>Cary stood his ground for a moment, meeting
the trooper eye to eye&mdash;then turned with
hanging head and walked a few steps back
into the woods.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, Virgie,&quot; he said, &quot;I guess we won't
get to see Colonel Morrison after all.&quot;</p>

<p>But Virgie, being a woman, had her own
ideas about what she would or would not do.
At the same moment that the trooper was
forcing her father step by step back into the
woods, Virgie was running madly towards the
stone wall and before either of the soldiers
could stop her she had clambered up on its
broad top and was calling out to a man who
clattered by at the head of a troop of cavalry.</p>

<p>&quot;Colonel Morrison! Colonel Morrison!&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>&quot;Halt!&quot;</p>

<p>At the sound of that piping, childish treble
calling his name in so unexpected a place the
officer at the head of the troop threw up his
gauntleted hand and brought the detachment
to a standstill in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, there,&quot; he said, turning curiously
around in his saddle. &quot;Who is it wants me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's <i>me</i>, Virgie!&quot; the child cried, leaping up
and down on the wall, all forgetful of her sore
foot. &quot;Come help Daddy and me&mdash;come
quick!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;what on earth&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison threw out a command to his men
and, wheeling his horse, spurred vigorously up
to the wall where he dismounted and came up
to take a closer view of the tangle haired little
person dancing on one foot.</p>

<p>&quot;Why&mdash;bless my soul if it isn't Virgie!&quot;
His arms opened to take her in when, suddenly,
his eye fell on O'Connell, standing at
attention on the other side of the wall.</p>

<p>&quot;O'Connell,&quot; he said, sternly, &quot;what is the
meaning of this? Why aren't you with your
detachment?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't <i>his</i> fault,&quot; Virgie interposed in
stout defense of the nice Yankee who carried
biscuits in his knapsack. &quot;He's under orders.&quot;</p>

<p>The glib use of the military term made a
smile flicker across Morrison's face, but his
eyes did not leave the troubled trooper.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Whose</i> orders?&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;Corporal Dudley, sir,&quot; was the stammering
answer.</p>

<p>At this moment Cary stepped forward and
the two officers exchanged nods of recognition.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me explain,&quot; the Confederate said.
&quot;Virgie and I were making for Richmond as
rapidly as we could. Here, by this spring,
we were put under arrest by a corporal and
four troopers. Naturally, I presented your
pass, but the corporal refused to honor it.
He then left me under guard and hurried off
to headquarters with the pass in his possession.&quot;</p>

<p>At this unwelcome news Morrison's head
jerked back as if he had been struck and his
lips tightened. Without the addition of another
word to Cary's story he saw all the dire
consequences to himself of what had been an
act of the commonest humanity. Yes, in
other times it would have been what any right
thinking human being would have done for
another in distress, but, unhappily, this was
war time and the best of motives were only
too often mis-read. In his mind's eye he saw
the vindictive Dudley, eager for a revenge
which he could not encompass any other way,
laying the proof of this act before his superiors
with an abundance of collateral evidence which,
he knew, would condemn him before any
military tribunal in the world. It mattered
not what kindly impulses had guided his hand
when he wrote the safeguard on the other side
of the paper on which Robert E. Lee had
previously placed his name, for it is not the
custom of courts martial to weigh the milk of
human kindness against the blood and iron of
war. The good and the safety of the greater
number demand the sacrifice of every man
who would imperil the cause by ill considered
generosity. Morrison could see that very
presently he would have to answer certain
stern questions.</p>

<p>Yet, there was a chance still that Dudley
might be headed off and this whole miserable
business stopped before revenge could set the
inexorable wheels in motion and he whirled
round on O'Connell with a sharp question:</p>

<p>&quot;Which way did Dudley go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Down the pike, then over the hill by the
wood road, sor&mdash;makin' for headquarters,&quot; the
young Irishman answered, only too glad of a
chance to help his officer out of what, he saw,
was a frightful situation.</p>

<p>&quot;How long ago?&quot; came back the instant
query.</p>

<p>&quot;Five minutes, sor. Ye cud catch him wid
a horse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; exclaimed Morrison, and he threw up
his hand to his men. &quot;Lieutenant Harris,&quot;
he shouted. &quot;Take a squad and ride to camp
by the wood road. Overtake Corporal Dudley
or intercept him at headquarters. Don't fail!
Get him and bring him here!&quot;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Harris's hand went up to his
hat in ready salute and he bellowed out his
orders.</p>

<p>&quot;Jennings! Hewlett! Brown! Hammond!
Burt! 'Bout face. Forward!&quot; Almost before
the words were out of his mouth Harris
and his men were riding madly down the road
in a chase, which the Lieutenant suspected,
meant something more to his colonel, than
merely the recovery of a safe-conduct for a
Confederate officer and a little girl.</p>

<p>Morrison turned to Trooper O'Connell and
jerked his thumb towards the road.</p>

<p>&quot;Report at my quarters this evening&mdash;at
nine,&quot; he said curtly. And the young Irishman,
thankful to be well out of the mess,
quickly clambered over the wall and disappeared
though not without a soft voiced farewell
from Virgie.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-by, Mr. Knapsack Man,&quot; called the
child. &quot;Thank you for the biscuits.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Cary came forward and gripped the
other's hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Colonel,&quot; he said earnestly, with full appreciation
of what was passing through Morrison's
mind, &quot;I hope no trouble will come of
this. If I had only known the vindictiveness
of this man&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a genially objecting
hand and a laugh which Morrison was
somehow able to make lighthearted.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that will be all right. Harris will get
him&mdash;never fear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so,&quot; he said, addressing Miss Virginia,
&quot;that bad man took your pass?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir. He did,&quot; Virgie answered, and
caught his hand in hers. &quot;He ran right away
with it&mdash;mean old thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then&mdash;we'll have to write you out
another one. A nice, clean, white one this
time. Come on, little sweetheart. We'll do
it together,&quot; and he took out a note book and
pencil.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, Morrison,&quot; Cary murmured, glancing
apprehensively at the troopers idling in the
road and very plainly interested in what the
small group were doing, &quot;do you really
think you'd better&mdash;on your own account?&quot;</p>

<p>Again Morrison's hand was raised in polite
objection. He had taken a sporting chance
when he wrote the pass which had been stolen
but because he had probably lost was no reason
why he shouldn't play the game out bravely
to the end. So he only smiled at Virgie, who
came and sat beside him, and began to write
the few short sentences of his second safe-conduct.
But while he wrote he was talking in
low tones which the troopers in the road could
not hear.</p>

<p>&quot;There's a line of your pickets about three
miles up the road, Cary,&quot; said he. &quot;If I
loaned you a horse, do you think Virgie could
ride behind you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Me?</i>&quot; pouted Virgie. &quot;Why, Daddy says
that when I was bornded, I came ridin' in on
a stork.&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison burst out laughing and dropped
his hand down on the small paw resting on
his knee.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, by St. George and the Dragon
we'll send you home to Jefferson Davis on a
snorting Pegasus!&quot;</p>

<p>Again Cary spoke to him in warning tones,
which at the same time thanked him unendingly
for the kindly thought.</p>

<p>&quot;You needn't trouble about the mount.
Why, man,&quot; he said huskily, &quot;you're in
trouble enough, as it is! And if our lines are
as close as you say they are&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Once more the Union officer checked him.</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't any trouble. Only&mdash;you'll have
to be careful of your approach, even to your
own lines. Those gray devils in the rifle pits
up there have formed the habit of shooting
<i>first</i> and asking questions <i>afterwards</i>. There
you are,&quot; and he tore the leaf from his note
book and handed it up with a faint smile.</p>

<p>The Southerner took it with a reluctant
hand.</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I wish I could thank you&mdash;Morrison,&quot;
he said in tones that shook with feeling,
&quot;but you see I&mdash;I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then please don't try. Because if you do
I'll&mdash;I'll have to hold Virgie as a prisoner of
war.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, young one,&quot; he said to the small Miss
Cary with a laugh, &quot;did you really get something
to eat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir. That is&mdash;we <i>almost</i> did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Almost?</i>&quot; he echoed.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; came the plaintive answer.
&quot;Eve'y time we start to eat&mdash;somethin' <i>always</i>
happens!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well, that <i>is</i> hard luck,&quot; he said with
a gentle squeeze of her frail body. &quot;But I'll
bet you it won't happen this time; not if a
whole regiment tries to stop it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; he suggested as he sprang to
his feet and began picking up dry twigs.
&quot;You can start in and munch on those heavenly
biscuits while this terrible Yankee builds the
fire.&quot; Cary made a move as if to help; but
Morrison checked him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, Cary, just you keep on sitting
still. This is no work for you. You're tired
out.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, Virgie, I know you want to get me
some water from the spring. Please pick out
the cleanest pieces of water you can and put
them carefully in the coffee pot. All right.
There you are. <i>'Tention!</i> Carr-ee coffee
pot! Right wheel! <i>March!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>With a carefree laugh he turned away to
light the little heap of twigs he had placed between
two flat stones. &quot;It's mighty considerate
of my boys to leave us all these things.
We'll call it the raid of Black Gum Spring.</p>

<p>&quot;And here comes the little lady with the
coffee pot filled just right. Now watch me
pour in the good old coffee&mdash;<i>real</i> coffee,
Virgie dear&mdash;not made from aco'ns.&quot; He
settled the pot on the fire and sat back with a
grin. &quot;Oh, oh! Don't watch it,&quot; he cried,
in well feigned alarm as Virgie, unwilling
to believe the sight, stooped over to feast
her eyes on the rich brown powder sinking
into the black gulf of the pot. &quot;If you do
that it will never, <i>never</i> boil!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; the child agreed pathetically,
and she sank wearily down against her father's
knee. &quot;I'll just pray for it to hurry
up.&quot;</p>

<p>The two men exchanged quiet smiles and
Cary murmured something in his daughter's
ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, I won't,&quot; she answered, and then
looked up at Morrison with a roguish light in
her dark eyes. &quot;He's only afraid I'll pray
so terribly hard that the old coffee pot will
boil over an' put out the fire.&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison, chuckling, now began to drag
something out of a rear pocket. Presently,
he uncorked it and held it up&mdash;a <i>flask</i>!</p>

<p>&quot;Here, Cary,&quot; he said, holding out a cup.
&quot;Join me, won't you? Of course, you understand&mdash;in
case a snake should bite us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Colonel Morrison,&quot; responded the Southerner,
&quot;you are certainly a man of ideas.&quot;</p>

<p>He waited for his foe to fill his own cup,
then raised his in a toast:</p>

<p>&quot;I drink to the health, sir, of you and yours.
Here's hoping that some day I may take <i>you</i>
prisoner!&quot;</p>

<p>At the quizzical look of surprise in the
other's face Cary's voice almost broke.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean, sir, it's the only way I could ever
hope to show you how much I appreciate&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped and covered his face with his
hands, not a little to his daughter's alarm.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, come, old chap,&quot; the Northerner
said bluffly, tapping him on the shoulder.
&quot;Brace up. It's the fortunes of war, you
know. One side or the other is bound to win.
Perhaps&mdash;who knows&mdash;it may be <i>your</i> turn
to-morrow. Well, sir&mdash;here goes. May it
soon be over&mdash;in the way that's best and wisest
for us all.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Virgie,&quot; he went on, when the toast
had been drunk, &quot;while I wash these cups suppose
you go on another voyage of discovery
through the magic knapsack for some sugar
for the coffee.&quot;</p>

<p>He watched her fling herself impetuously
on the knapsack. &quot;If you find any Yankee
spoons&mdash;put them under arrest. They haven't
any pass like yours.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he turned to Cary: &quot;Have any trouble
on the road as you came along?&quot;</p>

<p>The other man shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;None to speak of. We were stopped several
times of course, but each time your pass
let us through without delay&mdash;until we met
Dudley. And now I'm worried, Colonel,&quot; he
said frankly, while his eyes tried to tell the
other all that he feared without putting it in
words, &quot;worried on your account. It's easy
to see that the man has a grudge against
you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I'm afraid he has,&quot; was the thoughtful
reply. &quot;But really, Cary, you mustn't try
to carry any more burdens than your own, just
now. I know what you mean and what, I
daresay, you'd be only too willing to do, but
I can't permit it.&quot;</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the spectacle of
Virgie standing before them with anxiously
furrowed brow, a paper bag in one hand and
three spoons clutched in the other.</p>

<p>&quot;But Colonel Morrison,&quot; she was saying in
tragic tones, &quot;there isn't a drop of milk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Milk!&quot; he cried in mock despair. &quot;Well,
dash my buttons if I didn't forget to order a
cow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, <i>I</i> know what to do,&quot; cried the child.
Dropping her supplies and utensils she ran to
the wall and climbed up.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, there, <i>you</i>&quot; commanded the small
general with an imperious gesture to the assembled
troopers. &quot;One of you men ride
right over to camp and bring us back some
milk&mdash;an' butter.&quot;</p>

<p>At this abrupt demand of so small a rebel
on the commissary of the United States a roar
of laughter went up from the troopers, though
some of them had the grace to salute and so
relieve the child of embarrassment.</p>

<p>&quot;Virgie! Virgie!&quot; called her father, scandalized.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right, Cary,&quot; Morrison laughed.
&quot;She's only starting in at giving orders a little
earlier than most women.</p>

<p>&quot;Never you mind, Miss Brigadier,&quot; he comforted.
&quot;We'll have all those luxuries next
time, or when I come to see you in Richmond
after the war is over. Just now we'll do the
best we can. Come along.&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie got down from the wall and pattered
up to the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it ready yet?&quot; she asked with the perfect
directness of seven years.</p>

<p>&quot;In a minute now. Ah-hah! There she
goes.&quot;</p>

<p>He took the pot from the fire and set it
down on a rock where, presently, he brought a
cupful of cold water to pour in.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that to settle it?&quot; she asked of her
father.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, child&mdash;and I wish all our questions
were as easily cleared up. And now&mdash;to the
attack.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right-o. Virgie&mdash;pass the beautiful,
hand painted china and let's fill up. This one
for your daddy&mdash;you can put the sugar in.
Only don't burn those precious fingers.&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie carried the steaming cup to her
father and put it in his hands with shining
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;This is better than our old belt supper,
Daddy, isn't it?&quot; she said, with a flirt of her
tangled curls. &quot;Anyway&mdash;it <i>smells</i> nicer.&quot;</p>

<p>She was back at the sugar bag at once, digging
out spoonfuls for Morrison's coffee.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Miss Cary, I am indeed
obliged to you. Now do sit down and <i>eat</i>.
No, not another word till you've eaten two
whole biscuits!&quot;</p>

<p>For several ecstatic moments the child
munched her biscuits. It had been a long
time since she had eaten anything so delicious,
although if those same biscuits had appeared
on the Cary table a month ago they would
have probably been scorned. But eager as
her appetite was it did not stop the active
workings of her mind and she presently was
struck by an idea which tried to force itself
out through a mouthful of biscuit&mdash;with the
usual amusing results.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Virginia!</i>&quot; admonished her father.</p>

<p>Morrison laughed out like a boy and slapped
his knee.</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose we swallow&mdash;and try again.&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie, thus adjured, concentrated her mind
on the task&mdash;gulped, blinked, swallowed with
pathetically straining eyes, and then smiled
triumphantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, Daddy. I guess I wasn't very
polite.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Apology accepted. What were you going
to say?&quot;</p>

<p>The child looked up with a sweetly serious
look in her eyes that the two men recognized
as the forerunner of true womanly thought
for others.</p>

<p>&quot;I was only goin' to ask the Colonel if he
didn't think his men out there would like some
of these <i>heavingly</i> things to eat?&quot; she said
plaintively. &quot;It must be terrible&mdash;jus' to look
on!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, bless your little heart,&quot; the Northerner
cried. &quot;But don't you worry about the
boys. They'll have theirs when they get back
to camp. Go on and eat, Virgie. Stuff in
another biscuit. And, look! By Jupiter.
<i>Butter!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Evidently Trooper O'Connell during the
past twenty-four hours had foraged or blarneyed
most successfully for out of the knapsack
which he had left behind Morrison suddenly
produced a small earthenware jam jar
in which was something now indubitably
liquid in form but none the less sweet, yellow,
appetizing butter. Pouring a little on a biscuit
he held it out to her, speculating on what
she would say.</p>

<p>The tot took it hungrily and raised it to her
lips, her eyes shining and her face glowing
with anticipation. Then she paused and, with
a little cry of vexation over her selfishness,
held out the biscuit to her father.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, Daddy,&quot; she said. &quot;You take this&mdash;because
you tried to bring me somethin'
good to eat yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>The father threw a look at Morrison and
caught Virgie to him in a swift embrace.</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear,&quot; he said. &quot;Eat your nice buttered
biscuit and thank the good Lord for it.
Your father will get more fun out of seeing
you eat that little bit than he would out of
owning a whole cellar of big stone crocks jam
full. Do you know&mdash;I think when we get up
to Richmond you'll have to write a letter to
the Colonel&mdash;a nice long letter, thanking
him for all he's done. Won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause for a moment as the child
looked over at Morrison, revolving the thought
in her mind.</p>

<p>The Union officer had passed into a sudden
reverie, the hand holding his coffee cup hanging
listlessly over his knee. He was thinking
of another little girl, and one as dear to him as
this man's child was to her father. He was
wondering if the fortunes of war would ever
let him see her face again or hear her voice&mdash;or
feel her chubby arms around his neck. She
was very, very far away&mdash;well cared for, it
was true, but he knew only too well that it
would need but one malignant leaden missile
to make her future life as full of hardships as
those which the little tot beside him was passing
through to-day. So much, at least, for
the ordinary chances of war&mdash;he was beginning
to wonder how much had been added to
these perils by the matter of the pass and
whether his superiors would see the situation
as it had appeared to his eyes.</p>

<p>Into this sad reverie Virgie's soft voice
entered with a gentleness which roused but
did not startle him. When she spoke, it
seemed as if some subtle thought-current between
their minds had put the subject of his
dreams into the child's mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you reckon,&quot; the child said, curiously,
&quot;that Gertrude is havin' <i>her</i> supper now?&quot;</p>

<p>The Union officer looked up with eyes that
mutely blessed her.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear, I was thinking of her&mdash;and
her mother.&quot;</p>

<p>Again he was silent for a space, and when
he spoke, his voice was dreamy, tender, as he
seemed to look with unseeing eyes far into the
Northland where dwelt the people of his heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know, Cary, this war for us, the
men, may be a hell, but what is it for those we
leave at home? The women! Who wait&mdash;and
watch&mdash;and too often watch in vain. <i>We</i>
have the excitement of it&mdash;the rush&mdash;the battles&mdash;and
we think that ours is the harder part
when, in reality, we make our loved ones' lives
a deeper, blacker hell than our own. Theirs
to watch and listen with the love hunger in
their hearts, month in, month out and often
without a word! Theirs to starve on the
crusts of hope! Waiting&mdash;always waiting!
Hunting the papers for the thing they dread
to find; a name among the missing. A name
among the dead! Good Heaven! When I think
of it sometimes&mdash;&quot; Morrison dropped his
head between his clenched fists and groaned.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, old fellow, I know,&quot; the other
man answered, for in truth he <i>did</i> know, &quot;but
I want you to remember that for you the crusts
of hope will some day be the bread of life&mdash;and
love.&quot;</p>

<p>Slowly the Northerner's face came up out
of his hands and he seemed to take heart again.
After all, he had led a charmed life so far&mdash;perhaps
the God of Battles had written his
name among those who would some day go
back to live the life for which the Almighty
made them. God grant then that he might
have for his friend this man who, in the time
of his own greater grief, was unselfish enough
to console him. Ah! If God would only
grant that from this day on there would be no
more of this hideous fighting. Morrison's
eyes met the other's and he put out his
hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came the sound of a shot.
Another and another&mdash;then a volley, which
almost at once became a continuous rattle of
musketry.</p>

<p>The Northerner sprang to his feet. &quot;Look!
there go your pickets.&quot;</p>

<p>Struck dumb by this sudden return to the
actualities of life the two men stood motionless,
listening for every sound which might tell
them what it meant. For a little while they
had dreamed the dream of peace only to have
it rudely shattered.</p>

<p>But Virgie had not followed them in their
dreams, for she was an extremely practical
young lady. Having seen food, real food,
vanish away before her very eyes several times
already she was quite prepared to see it happen
again.</p>

<p>&quot;There!&quot; she said, in tones in which prophecy
and resignation were oddly mingled. &quot;Didn't
I jus' <i>know</i> somethin' was goin' to happen!&quot;</p>

<p>By this time Morrison had run to the stone
wall and sprung to its top. Out in the road
the troopers had mounted without waiting for
command and with one accord had faced towards
the firing.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you see anything?&quot; Cary called.</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Morrison. &quot;I guess we
came too close to your nest&mdash;and the hornets
are coming out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Turner!&quot; he commanded, and a trooper's
hand went up, &quot;ride up to the fork of the road.
Learn what you can and report.&quot;</p>

<p>As the cavalryman struck his heels into his
horse's sides and dashed up the road Cary put
the wishes of both men into words.</p>

<p>&quot;It's too near sundown for a battle. It will
only be a skirmish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ye-e-e-s, possibly,&quot; the Northerner assented,
and he looked thoughtfully at Virgie,
&quot;but still&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't send you forward now&mdash;in the face
of that fire. And, for that matter, I can't
send you to the rear. In five minutes this
road will be glutted with cavalry and guns.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind, Morrison,&quot; the Southerner
returned. &quot;I couldn't go now&mdash;anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary opened out his hands in a simple gesture.
&quot;Because, in case of trouble for you at
headquarters, I'm <i>still</i> your prisoner.&quot; With
his eyes brave and steady on the others he took
the newly written pass from his breast&mdash;and
tore it in pieces. &quot;When you want me,&quot; he
said, &quot;you'll find me&mdash;<i>here</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>If there had been time for argument Morrison
would have hotly protested against such
self-sacrifice, but events were crowding upon
them too fast. From down the road came the
sound of furious galloping. Almost at once
Lieutenant Harris, riding hard at the head
of a troop of cavalry, swept round the curve
and drew his horse upon his haunches.</p>

<p>&quot;Colonel Morrison!&quot; he shouted. &quot;You are
ordered&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One moment, Lieutenant,&quot; interrupted
Morrison in tones so even that Cary marveled
at his composure, &quot;<i>Did you get Corporal
Dudley?</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Cary's ears ached for the answer. He
knew just as well as the questioner the danger
which might now be disclosed or be forever forgotten
and his heart went out to the other in
this moment of hideous suspense.</p>

<p>There was an instant of hesitation and then
came the answer.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>No, sir!</i> We tried hard but couldn't make
it.&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison's face did not change but his hands
tightened until the nails dug deep into his
palms. He had played&mdash;and lost.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on with your report,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Harris pulled in his fretting horse and delivered
his significant news.</p>

<p>&quot;The Rebels are advancing in force. I was
sent back to you with orders to join Major
Foster at the fork and hold the road at any
cost. Two light field pieces are coming to
your support. Our main batteries are back
there&mdash;in the woods.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said Morrison, &quot;we go at once.&quot;
Turning back to Virgie he caught her up in
his arms and kissed her. &quot;Good-by, little
sweetheart. Hide under the rocks and keep
close.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-by, Morrison,&quot; Gary said, as they
struck hands. &quot;I can't wish you luck&mdash;but
our hearts are with you as a man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, old fellow,&quot; said the enemy, as he
sprang over the wall &quot;It helps&mdash;God
knows.&quot;</p>

<p>He caught at his horse's mane and threw
himself into the saddle without touching the
stirrup, while his voice roared out his command.</p>

<p>&quot;Ready, men! Forward!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-by,&quot; shrilled Virgie in her childish
treble. &quot;Good-by, Colonel! Don't get
hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy!&quot; she cried, as they crouched down
in their hiding place behind the wall. &quot;Is
there going to be a&mdash;a <i>battle</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only a little one. But you won't be
afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>A rattle of approaching wheels came from
down the road, the shock of steel tires striking
viciously against the stones, the cries and oaths
of the drivers urging the horses forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Look!&quot; cried Cary, springing to his feet
in spite of the danger in which his gray uniform
placed him. &quot;Here come the field pieces.
In a minute now the dogs will begin to bark.&quot;</p>

<p>With a roar of wheels and a clash of harness
and accouterments the guns rushed by while
the child stared and stared, her big eyes almost
starting out of her face.</p>

<p>&quot;The dogs!&quot; she said in wonder. &quot;There
wasn't a single dog there!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another kind of dog,&quot; her father said with
a meaning look. &quot;And their teeth are <i>very</i>
long. Ah! There they go! Over yonder on
the hill&mdash;in the edge of the woods. The Yankee
dogs are barking. Now listen for the answer.&quot;</p>

<p>Together they listened, father and daughter,
with straining ears&mdash;listened for the defiant
reply of those men who, being Americans,
were never beaten until hunger and superior
numbers forced them to the wall.</p>

<p>&quot;Boom!&quot; A great, ear-filling sound crashed
over the hills and rolled, echoing, through the
woods.</p>

<p>&quot;That's us! That's us!&quot; the man cried out
exultantly, while he caught the child closer in
his arms. &quot;Hear our people talking, honey?
Hear 'em talk!&quot;</p>

<p>But overhead something was coming
through the air and the child shrank down in
terror&mdash;something that whined and screamed
as it sped on its dreadful way and seemed like
a demon out of hell searching for his prey.</p>

<p>&quot;Lord a' mercy, Daddy!&quot; the child cried out.
&quot;What's <i>that</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>He patted her head consolingly. &quot;Nothing
at all but a shell. They sound much worse
than they really are. Don't be afraid. Nothing
will hurt you.&quot;</p>

<p>From the forks of the road the sound of
volley firing grew stronger and, as if in response,
the road to the Union rear now turned
into a stream of living blue, with cavalry
madly galloping and sweating infantry hurrying
forward as fast as their legs could carry
them.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, Virgie, look!&quot; her father cried, holding
her head a little way above the wall. &quot;See
those bayonets shining back there across the
road. A whole regiment of infantry. And
they're going up against our <i>men across an
open field!</i> By Jiminy, but those Yanks will
get a mustard bath. Ah-hah!&quot; he chortled, as
a roar of musketry broke out. &quot;I told you so!
Our boys are after them. Good work! Good
work!&quot;</p>

<p>But again a shell passed over them and
again the world was filled with that awful
whining, shrieking sound.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; the child cried, with quivering
lips, but still dry eyed. &quot;I don't <i>like</i> those
things. I don't <i>like</i>'em.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There, there, darling,&quot; he comforted as
they shrank closer under the protection of the
wall. &quot;Keep down under my arm and they
won't bother you.&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke a twig with a fresh yellow break
in it fell from a tree and struck his upturned
face. He winced at the thought that the bullet
might have flown a few feet lower. And
meanwhile the sound of the firing came steadily
closer.</p>

<p>&quot;By Jove!&quot; he murmured to himself, &quot;it's a
bigger rumpus than I thought.&quot;</p>

<p>This indeed was true. What had at first
promised to be only a skirmish between the
outposts of the two entrenched armies, now
developed into a general engagement covering
a space of half a mile along the line. A reconnoitering
force of Federal cavalry had ridden
too close to the rifle pits of the Confederates,
and, as Morrison himself expressed it,
&quot;the hornets came out and began to sting.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Foster, commanding a larger force
of cavalry, rode out in support of his reconnoitering
party, and found himself opposed,
not by a straggling line of Rebel pickets, but
by a moving wall of tattered gray, the units of
which advanced on a low-bent run, crouching
behind some bush or stone, to fire, reload and
advance again.</p>

<p>An aide raced back to the Union lines to ask
for help in support of Foster's slender force
of cavalry; and thus the order came to Morrison
to join the detachment and hold the enemy
until reinforcements could be formed and
pushed to the firing line.</p>

<p>The delay, however, was well nigh fatal for
Morrison and Major Foster, and from the
point where Cary and little Virgie watched,
the case of the Union horsemen seemed an
evil one. True, that infantry and guns were
soon advancing to their aid on a &quot;double-quick&quot;;
yet all the advantage seemed to lie
with the ragged, sharp-shooting Southerners.</p>

<p>The crackle of musketry increased; the dust
rolled up and intermingled with the wreathes
of drifting smoke, and through it came the vicious
whine of leaden messengers of death.</p>

<p>Then, borne on the wind, came a sound that
he would know till his dying day&mdash;<i>the rebel
yell</i>. An exultant scream,&mdash;a cry of unending
hate, defiance, <i>victory</i>!</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet. Off came the battered
old campaign hat and unmindful that he
stood there hidden in the woods and that his
voice could carry only a few yards against
the roar of battle, he swung it over his head:
and shouted out his encouragement.</p>

<p>&quot;Look! We're whipping 'em. Virgie, do
you hear? We're getting them on the run.
Come on, boys! Come on!&quot;</p>

<p>He felt her clutch on his sleeve. With
wide eyes grown darker than ever with excitement,
she asked her piteous question.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy! <i>Will they kill the Colonel?</i>&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment he could not answer. Then,
with a groan he gave back his answer: &quot;I
<i>hope</i> not, darling. I hope not!&quot;</p>

<p>Down the road a riderless horse was coming,
head up and stirrups flying. As it galloped
past Cary scrutinized it closely and was
glad he did not recognize it. In its wake
came soldiers, infantry and dismounted cavalry,
firing, retreating, loading and firing
again, but always retreating.</p>

<p>&quot;Here come the stragglers,&quot; he cried.
&quot;We're whipping 'em! Close, darling, <i>close</i>.
Lie down against the wall.&quot;</p>

<p>He crouched above her, shielding her as best
he could with his body. Then, suddenly, a
man in blue leaped on the wall not ten feet
away. He had meant to seize the wall as a
breastwork and fight from behind it, but
before he dropped down he would fire one last
shot. His gun came up to his shoulder&mdash;he
aimed at some unseen foe and fired. But from
somewhere, out of the crash of sound and the
rolling powder smoke, a singing missile came
and found its mark. The man in blue bent
over suddenly, wavered, then toppled down
inside the wall, his gun ringing on the stones
as he fell.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy!&quot; the child whispered, with ashen
face, &quot;it's the biscuit man. It's HARRY!&quot;</p>

<p>Her father's hand went out instinctively to
cover her eyes. &quot;Don't look, dear! Don't
look!&quot;</p>

<p>The road was choked now. Cavalry and
infantry, all in a mad rush for the rear, were
tearing by while the two field pieces which but
a moment ago had gone into action with such
a deadly whirl came limping back with slashed
traces and splintered wheels. With fascinated
eyes the Rebel officer watched from behind
his wall, while everything, even his child, was
forgotten in the lust for victory. And so he
did not hear the faint voice behind him that
cried out in an agony of thirst and pain.</p>

<p>&quot;Water! Water! Help! Someone&mdash;give
water!&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie, with dilated eyes and heaving breast,
crouched low as long as she could and then
gave up everything to the pitiful appeal ringing
in her ears. Quick as a flash, she sped
away on bare feet over rocks and sharp, pointed
branches of fallen trees to the spring, where
she caught up a cup and filled it to the brim.
Another swift rush and she reached the fallen
man in blue and had the cup at his lips, while
her arm went under his head to lift it.</p>

<p>&quot;Virgie!&quot; her father cried, frantic at the
sight. With a great leap he was at her side,
forcing her down to the ground and covering
her with his body.</p>

<p>The trooper's head sank back and his eyes
began to dull.</p>

<p>&quot;May God bless ye, little one,&quot; he murmured.
&quot;Heaven&mdash;<i>Mary</i>&mdash;<i>!</i>&quot; His lips gave
out one long, shuddering sigh. His body
grew slack and his chin fell. Trooper Harry
O'Connell had fought his last fight&mdash;had
passed to his final review.</p>

<p>One look at the boyish face so suddenly
gone gray and bloodless and Gary caught
Virgie up in his arms. &quot;Come dear, you can't
help him any more,&quot; and with a crouching run
they were back once more in the shelter of the
wall.</p>

<p>And now the shriek of the shells and the
whine of the bullets came shriller than before.
All around them the twigs were dropping,
while the acrid powder smoke rolled in through
the trees and burnt their eyes and throats.
Again came men in blue retreating and among
them an officer on horseback, wheeling his
animal madly around among them and shouting
encouragement as he tried to face them
to the front. &quot;Keep at it, men,&quot; Morrison
was crying, half mad with rage. &quot;One
decent stand and we can hold them. Give it
to them hard. Stand, I tell you. <i>Stand!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>All around him, however, men were falling
and those who were left began to waver.
&quot;Steady, men! Don't flinch,&quot; came the shout
again. &quot;Ah-hah, you <i>would</i>, would you?
<i>Coward!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison's sword held flatwise, thudded
down on the back of a man who had flung
away his gun. &quot;Get back in the fight, you
dog! Get back!&quot;</p>

<p>He whipped out his revolver and pointed
it till the gun had been snatched up, then fired
all its chambers at the oncoming hordes in
gray.</p>

<p>&quot;One more stand,&quot; he yelled. &quot;One
more&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Beside him the color sergeant gave a moan
and bent in the middle like a hinge. Another
slackening of his body and the stricken bearer
of the flag plunged from his saddle, the colors
trailing in the dust.</p>

<p>Morrison spurred his mount toward the
fallen man, bending to grasp the colors from
the tight gripped hand; but even as he bent,
his horse went down. He leaped to save himself,
then turned once more, snatched at the
flag of his routed regiment and waved it above
his head.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Stand, boys, and give it to 'em!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>A shout went up&mdash;not from the men he
sought to rally to his flag, but from those who
would win it at a cost of blood, for his troopers
were running on a backward road, and Morrison
fought alone. The &quot;gray devils&quot; were all
around him now, and he backed against the
wall, fighting till his sword was sent spinning
from his fist by the blow of a musket butt;
then, grasping the color-pole in both his hands,
he parried bayonet thrusts and saber strokes,
panting, breathing in hot, labored gasps, and
cursing his enemies from a hoarse, parched
throat.</p>

<p>A hideous, unequal fight it was, and soon
Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison must fall as his
colors fell and be trampled in the dust; yet
now through an eddying drift of smoke came
another ragged Southerner, a grim, gaunt man
whose voice was as hoarse as Morrison's, who
had grasped a saber from the blood stained
rocks and waved it above his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Back, boys! Don't kill that man!&quot;</p>

<p>Among them he plunged till he reached the
side of Morrison, then turned and faced the
brothers of his country and his State. With
a downward stroke he arrested a saber thrusts
and then struck upward at a rifle's mouth as it
spit its deadly flame.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't kill him! Do you hear?&quot; he cried, as
he beat at the bayonet points. &quot;I'm Cary!
Herbert Cary!&mdash;<i>on the staff of General Lee!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>For an instant the attacking Southerners
stood aghast at the sight of this raging man in
gray who defended a Yankee officer; and yet
he had made no saber stroke to wound or kill;
instead, his weapon had come between their
own and the life of a well-nigh helpless foe.
For a moment more they paused and looked
with wondering eyes, and in that moment their
victory was changed to rout.</p>

<p>A bugle blared. A thundering rush of
hoof beats sounded on the road, and the Union
re&euml;nforcements swept around the curve. Six
abreast they came, a regiment of strong,
straight riders, hungry for battle, hot to retrieve
the losing fortune of the day. The
road was too narrow for a concentrated rush,
so they streamed into the fields on either side,
re-formed, and swept like an avalanche of blue
upon their prey. The guns in the woods now
thundered forth afresh, their echoes rolling out
across the hills, and the attacking Rebels
turned and fled, like leaves before a storm.</p>

<p>On one side of the road, Morrison and Cary
shrank down beside the wall to let the Union
riders pass; on the other, all that was left of
the Rebel force ran helter-skelter for a screen
of protecting trees. But before the last one
disappeared he threw up his gun and fired,
haphazard, in the direction whence he had
come.</p>

<p>As if in reply came the sound of a saber
falling from a man's hand and striking on a
stone. Under his very eyes and just as he
was putting out his hand to grip the others
Morrison saw Herbert Cary sinking slowly to
the ground.</p>

<p>And then, through the yellow dust clouds
and the powder smoke and all the horrid reek
of war, a child came running with outstretched
arms and piteous voice&mdash;a frightened child,
weeping for the father who had thrown himself
headlong into peril to save another's life
and who, perhaps, had lost his own.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>The headquarters of the Army of the Potomac
on the morning of August 4, 1864, were at
City Point near where the Appomattox meets
the James. Here the grim, silent man in
whose hands lay the destinies of the United
States sent out the telegrams which kept the
Federal forces gnawing at the cage in which
Lee had shut himself and meanwhile held to
his strategic position south of Richmond. To
his left and west lay Petersburg still unconquered,
but Petersburg could wait, for Early's
gray clad troopers were scourging the Shenandoah
and the menace must be removed. To
this end Grant had sent a telegram to Washington
three days before expressing in unmistakable
terms what he wished General Sheridan
and his cavalry to accomplish. They were
to go over into the Shenandoah and, putting
themselves <i>south</i> of the enemy, follow him to
the death. To which telegram the tall, lank,
furrow-faced man in the White House whose
kindly heart was bursting with the strain replied
in characteristic fashion and told him
that his purpose was exactly right. And
then, with a gleam of humor, warned him
against influences in Washington which would
prevent its carrying out unless he forced it.</p>

<p>This message had come but a few minutes
before and it had been received with silent
satisfaction for Grant knew now that Abraham
Lincoln and he were in perfect accord
as to the means for swiftly bringing on the
end. But the plans must be well laid and to
that end he must leave City Point within a few
hours and go north. And so he was standing
at a window of his headquarters this morning
with his eyes resting unseeingly on the camp,
while his cool, quiet mind steadily forged out
his schemes.</p>

<p>Unlike the headquarters of &quot;play&quot; armies
where all is noise and confusion and bloodied
orderlies throw themselves off of plunging
horses and gasp out their reports, the room in
which General Grant did his work was
strangely quiet.</p>

<p>It was a large, square room with high ceiling
and wall paper which had defied all the
arts of Europe to render interesting in design.
Furniture was neither plentiful nor comfortable&mdash;a
slippery, black horse-hair sofa, a few
horse-hair chairs and, at one side of the room,
a table and a desk, littered with papers, maps
and files. At the table Grant's adjutant,
Forbes, sat writing. Facing him was the
door opening out into the hallway of the
house where two sentries stood on guard. In
the silence which pervaded the room and in the
quiet application to the work in hand there
was a perfect reflection of the mind of him
who stood impassive at the window with his
back turned, a faint blue cloud of cigar smoke
rising above his head.</p>

<p>A quick step sounded in the corridor&mdash;the
step of one who bears a message. An orderly
appeared in the doorway, spoke to the two sentries
and was passed in with a salute to Forbes.</p>

<p>&quot;For General Grant,&quot; he said, holding out
a folded note of white paper. &quot;Personal from
Lieutenant Harris, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>At the sound of his name the General turned
slowly and accepted the note which the orderly
presented. He took it without haste and yet
without any perceptible loss of time or motion
and, as always, without unnecessary words.
Scanning it, he shifted his cigar to one corner
of his mouth where its smoke would not rise
into his eyes, thought for an instant, then
nodded shortly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll see him. At once.&quot;</p>

<p>Dismissed, the orderly saluted and passed
quickly out. The General, with his chin in his
collar and his cigar held between his fingers
at nearly the same level, moved back to the
window and stood there silently as before.
He knew what Lieutenant Harris would wish
to speak to him about. A few weeks before a
Lieutenant-Colonel of cavalry had been court-martialed
on the charge of allowing the escape
of a spy. The court had found him guilty
and its findings had been submitted to the
higher authorities and endorsed by them. A
copy of these reports now lay on his desk.
All this his Adjutant, Forbes, knew as well
as the General himself, but if Forbes had
thought it worth while to speculate on the extent
of his commander's interest he might have
guessed for years without ever drawing one
logical conclusion from all the hints that that
impassive face and figure gave him.</p>

<p>Again a ringing step in the corridor and
this time Lieutenant Harris came into the
room, his hand going up in salute. But his
General was still looking out of the window,
his eyes on a dead level. There was a silence
and then&mdash;without turning around&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Lieutenant, what is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A short conference, General, if you'll
grant it. The case of Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrison.&quot; It was hard work to talk to one
who kept his back turned and Harris was embarrassed.</p>

<p>The smoke from the General's cigar still
curled lazily upwards.</p>

<p>&quot;Reprieve?&quot; came the monosyllabic question.</p>

<p>Harris caught himself together and put all
his feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;No, General. A <i>pardon</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>At once Grant wheeled and stood gazing at
him keenly.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Pardon?</i>&quot; he said, and he advanced with
deliberation to the desk where he stood with
his eyes steady on Harris' face. &quot;Lieutenant!
Do you want me to think you are out of your
mind?&quot;</p>

<p>Before Harris could reply Grant stopped
him with a gesture and picked up a batch of
papers which lay on the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;The man has been given every chance. He
has been court-martialed&mdash;and found guilty.&quot;</p>

<p>He dropped the papers in the case back on
the desk. &quot;And you&mdash;his counsel&mdash;having
failed to prove him otherwise now come to <i>me</i>&mdash;for
pardon.&quot;</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers. &quot;Lieutenant, you
are wasting time.&quot; And he turned away,
pausing for a moment to turn over a sheaf
here and there on his desk and meditate their
contents. The incident of Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrison has been disposed of and, in
another moment would be forgotten. It was
now or never for Harris and he answered
quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope not, sir. Neither yours nor mine.&quot;
And then, as the General looked up with some
surprise at this retort. &quot;You have read the
findings of the court?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; was the grim reply. &quot;And approve
the sentence. To-morrow he will be shot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; acknowledged Harris. &quot;Unless
<i>you</i> intervene.&quot;</p>

<p>At this curiously insistent plea for clemency
the short, stocky bearded man who, to so few,
had the bearing of a great general, faced Lieutenant
Harris and gave him a look which
made the young officer's bravery falter for a
long moment.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>I?</i>&quot; said the General, with a searching note
in his voice which seemed to probe coldly and
with deadly accuracy among the strenuous
emotions in the young man's mind. &quot;Harris&mdash;you
are an officer of promise. Don't cut
that promise short.&quot; With a flick of his ashes
to one side he turned away. The cigar went
back into the corner of his sardonic mouth.</p>

<p>Harris strode forward an impulsive step
and threw out his hands.</p>

<p>&quot;It is worth the risk. When a man is condemned
to die&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The General wheeled with more impatience
than the Adjutant, Forbes, had seen him exhibit
through many vexatious, worrying
months. His voice took on a rasping note.
He tapped the papers on the desk with grim
significance.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison has failed in
his military duty. He released a Rebel spy&mdash;proved
himself a traitor to his cause.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A traitor, General?&quot; protested the young
officer. &quot;Do you call a man a traitor who
fought as Morrison did a week ago? Who
stood his ground till his whole command was
shot to pieces! And then stood alone&mdash;defending
his colors in the face of hell let loose!&quot;</p>

<p>The appeal was impassioned, its sincerity
and humanity undoubted. Yet it seemingly
only served to make the grim rules of war
more unyielding than ever.</p>

<p>Choosing his words with more than ordinary
care, and speaking them in firm, even
tones, the General made his reply.</p>

<p>&quot;No act of bravery can atone for a soldier's
lapse from duty.&quot; He sat down at his desk
and began to write.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances Lieutenant
Harris might have accepted defeat for there
seemed no use in trying to break down that
iron will or touch the heart of this relentless
soldier. But this was something more than
an ordinary case and Harris was more than
simply Morrison's counsel&mdash;he was his friend.
The two had fought together through three
hard campaigns; they had shared food and
water and shelter, had slept together for
warmth on sodden fields, had exchanged such
confidences as two officers from the same town
in the North but of unequal rank may exchange
under the pressure of war-time emotions.
If there was one man living who knew
Morrison's heart and appreciated his motives
to the uttermost it was his lieutenant and the
young officer was prepared to lose his commission,
aye, even face prison for insubordination
if continued opposition to the Commander-in-Chief
would result in a re-hearing. And so
he caught himself together for the second time
and returned to the charge.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not offer his courage as a plea for
pardon,&quot; he said, and turned to his general
with half a smile, &quot;but still I find in Shakespeare&mdash;and
in Blackstone&mdash;the suggestion of
tempering justice with mercy.&quot;</p>

<p>Grant tossed aside his pencil, repeating the
last word slowly, bitterly:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Mercy!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>He rose from his seat and stood beside his
table, speaking with a low but almost fierce
intensity:</p>

<p>&quot;They call me a war machine! I am! And
you&mdash;and all the rest&mdash;are parts of it! A
lever! A screw! A valve! A wheel! A
machine half human&mdash;yes! A thing of muscle
and bone and blood&mdash;but without a heart! A
merciless <i>machine</i>, whose wheels must turn
and turn till we grind out this rebellion to the
dust of peace!&quot;</p>

<p>He paused impressively, and in the hard,
cold words which followed, all hope for Morrison
seemed to fade and die.</p>

<p>&quot;If a wheel once fails to do its work&mdash;discard
it!&mdash;for another and a better one! <i>We
want no wheels that slip their cogs!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>The General ceased and turned to his littered
table; but Harris was not yet beaten.</p>

<p>&quot;No, General,&quot; he answered bravely, &quot;but
there happens to be a flaw ... in your machine's
control.&quot; The General looked up,
frowning sharply; but Harris still went on:
&quot;In a military court we have condemned a
man to die&mdash;<i>and the facts have not been
proved!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Amazed more at the young officer's obstinate
temerity than his words the General stared
at him.</p>

<p>&quot;How so?&quot; he asked, with irony.</p>

<p>Harris opened out his hands with a simple
gesture that seemed to leave his logic to the
judgment of any impartial observer.</p>

<p>&quot;In times of peace, my profession is that
of the Law. I know my ground&mdash;and,&quot; in
rising tones of sincerity, &quot;I challenge you to
shake it in any civil court in Christendom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Strong words, young man,&quot; came the
stern reply. &quot;For your sake, I hope they are
warranted. What is your point? Get at it!&quot;</p>

<p>Harris drew a short breath of relief. He
had cleverly switched the appeal from grounds
on which he stood no chance whatever to those
where he did not fear any intellect in a fair
fight.</p>

<p>&quot;The evidence,&quot; he said calmly, &quot;was purely
circumstantial. In the first place, it is alleged
that my client captured a Rebel spy, one Herbert
Cary, who was hiding in the loft of a
cabin.&quot;</p>

<p>The General's caustic tones interrupted.
&quot;To which fact,&quot; he said, &quot;there were only <i>ten</i>
witnesses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, General,&quot; was the faintly smiling
agreement. &quot;Ten! But not one of them actually
<i>saw</i> the man! They <i>believe</i> he was
there, but they cannot swear to it.&quot;</p>

<p>Grant made a motion as of putting away
something of no consequence. &quot;Immaterial&mdash;in
view of the other facts. Well&mdash;what
else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Next, it is claimed that Morrison released
this spy and allowed him to enter the Union
lines&mdash;without regard to consequences.&quot;</p>

<p>The General gave a short exclamation of
impatience, and struck the papers on his desk
with the flat of his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;And that is <i>proved</i>,&quot; he said, sharply.
&quot;Proved by several officers who stopped your
spy at points along the road.&quot;</p>

<p>He singled out a soiled piece of paper from
the sheaf before him and held it up, a piece of
paper which bore writing on both sides.</p>

<p>&quot;When taken, <i>this pass</i> was found on his
person. Not circumstantial evidence, but
<i>fact</i>. Signed on one side by R.E. Lee and,
on the other, by Colonel Morrison.&quot; He
laughed shortly over the futility of argument
under such circumstances. &quot;Do you presume
to contest this, <i>too</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>To his amazement the young officer facing
him bowed easily and smiled in turn.</p>

<p>&quot;I <i>do</i>. Emphatically. <i>No pass</i> was given
Herbert Cary either by Colonel Morrison <i>or</i>
General Lee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot; cried the General angrily.</p>

<p>Harris only pointed.</p>

<p>&quot;Read it, sir&mdash;if you please.&quot; He watched
till Grant's eyes started to scan the pass again,
and then repeated the words which he knew
so well.</p>

<p>&quot;Pass <i>Virginia Cary</i> and escort through
Federal&mdash;and Confederate lines.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Virginia Cary,' General, is a non-combatant
and a child. 'Escort' may mean a
single person&mdash;or it may mean a whole troop
of cavalry.&quot;</p>

<p>To his infinite relief and joy his Commanding
General looked up at him thoughtfully,
then slowly rose from his desk and took a turn
about the room, followed by a faint blue trail
of cigar smoke. He paused.</p>

<p>&quot;And what does <i>Cary</i> say?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>Again Harris smiled the quiet smile of the
lawyer who has been confronted with such
questions before and knows well how to answer
them.</p>

<p>&quot;He, too, is on trial for his life. His evidence,
naturally, was not admitted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! Then what says <i>Morrison</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, sir,&quot; was the young lieutenant's
calm reply. &quot;The burden of proof lies with
the prosecution&mdash;not with the defendant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And this is your contention&mdash;your <i>legal</i>
flaw in my machine?&quot; the General asked
sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;It is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good, sir&mdash;very good. In that case
we'll call in these silent partners and dig into
this case until we reach rock bottom!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Forbes,&quot; he ordered. &quot;Send for the prisoner,
Mr. Morrison&mdash;and the Rebel, Herbert
Cary. I want both of them here&mdash;at once!&quot;</p>

<p>In the pause which followed the Adjutant's
exit Harris interposed an objection.</p>

<p>&quot;Your method, General, is hardly just to
the interests of my client.&quot;</p>

<p>Grant turned on him with something mere
than impatience. He was growing angry.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant Harris! Are you asking me
to pardon a guilty man? It's the truth I want&mdash;not
legal technicalities. Next you'll be asking
me not to hang this Rebel spy because he
has&mdash;a baby!&quot;</p>

<p>He went back to his accustomed place at the
window and stood looking out again, his hands
clasped loosely behind his back, the eternal
cigar smoke rising above his head. Then, to
the young lieutenant's amazement, he asked
a question in tones of ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Harris,&quot; he said. &quot;Who was the man who
preferred these charges to start with?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Corporal Dudley,&quot; was the eager answer.</p>

<p>&quot;And there, General, is another point and
a vital one that was not brought out. In reporting
his Colonel, Dudley was actuated not
by a spirit of military duty, but personal revenge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Revenge? Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because Morrison shot and killed Dudley's
brother&mdash;a Sergeant in his command.&quot;</p>

<p>The General came back from his window.</p>

<p>&quot;Again&mdash;why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For insubordination&mdash;incendiarism&mdash;attempted
desertion,&quot; came the swift reply.</p>

<p>The General's eyebrows raised a fraction of
an inch. He seated himself at his desk and
unrolled a map.</p>

<p>&quot;Any witnesses of the Sergeant's death?&quot; he
asked evenly as he proceeded to study his map.</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately, only one,&quot; Harris replied.
&quot;An old negro&mdash;now in our camp&mdash;answering
to the name of William Lewis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis&mdash;Lewis,&quot; said Grant thoughtfully.
He referred for a moment to a file of papers
and then looked up. &quot;Is that the old codger
who's been worrying my entire staff for
permission to go through our lines to his
home?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, General,&quot; said Harris, with a smile,
for Unc' Billy's persistency and his troubles
were known to everyone he met.</p>

<p>&quot;Good! It's about time we got even him,&quot;
the General remarked sardonically. &quot;Have
him in! See to it, Forbes.&quot; And again he
bent over his map.</p>

<p>Forbes, passing out again, paused as Harris
gestured.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll find him somewhere near the guard
house,&quot; the Lieutenant said with a flicker of
a, smile. &quot;The old man has been regularly
camping out there since he learned that his
master was inside.&quot;</p>

<p>A minute passed and then, from a short distance
away, came the sound of a squad of soldiers
marching. In single file, with the two
prisoners in line, the squad came into the hallway
and stopped at the doorway.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Halt! Left face! Order arms! Prisoners
file out!</i>&quot; The two prisoners stepped forward
and entered the room.</p>

<p>Thanks to expert surgical work since he entered
Union lines, Herbert Cary's wounds
had healed quickly while plenty of good food
had done the rest. His eyes may not have
been bright with hope but at least they were
clear with health and his straight back and
squared shoulders showed that the man's fighting
spirit had not left him even under the adverse
decision of a court-martial.</p>

<p>Of the two, Morrison seemed the graver and
quieter. With his sword taken from him and
his shoulder straps ripped off the man who
had been a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army of
the Potomac only the day before stood looking
at his general without the slightest hope for
clemency. Yet, with all the sad, quiet look of
resignation in his eyes, behind them glowed a
wonderful light&mdash;the light of self-sacrifice.
For he had chosen to put on the tender glove
of humanity and grip hands with the mailed
gauntlet of war, and though he had been
crushed yet even in this bitter hour they could
not take from him the knowledge that the
Commander in Chief of all spiritual armies
would stand forever on his side. They could
take his sword and shoulder straps but they
could not rob him of that divine consolation.</p>

<p>And so the two stood with their eyes steady
on the General&mdash;the Confederate, hard and
defiant&mdash;the Union officer with a strange, sad
glow on his face.</p>

<p>But the General paid them no attention.
He was still studying the map laid out before
him on his desk, the cigar in the corner of his
mouth drawing one side of his face into harsh,
deep lines. As a matter of fact, Ulysses Simpson
Grant was very far removed from harshness&mdash;he
was simply and solely efficiency personified.
When nothing was to be said
General Grant said nothing. To do otherwise
was waste.</p>

<p>Presently he looked up and saw that while
Forbes had given the two prisoners chairs directly
in front of his desk one of the important
factors in the business in hand had not been
produced.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Forbes, well? Where is the negro?&quot;
He asked crisply. &quot;Bring him in! Bring him
in!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In a moment, General,&quot; responded the Adjutant,
hastening to the doorway as the tread
of feet sounded again in the hallway. Dismissing
the two privates who had arrived with
Uncle Billy between them he led the old man
down to the desk and left him there, bowing
and scraping a little and holding his hat in
front of him in both hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Wan' see <i>me</i>, suh?&quot; ventured Uncle Billy,
intruding delicately on the General's calculations.
&quot;Here I is!&quot;</p>

<p>General Grant looked up quickly and ran
his eye over the old man.</p>

<p>&quot;Your name!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Er&mdash;William Lewis, seh. Yas, seh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To whom do you belong?&quot;</p>

<p>Although Uncle Billy's back was not particularly
straight this sudden question introduced
a stiffening into it which made it more
upright than it had been in years.</p>

<p>&quot;I b'longs to Cap'n Hubbert Cary, seh&mdash;of
de Confed'it Army. Das who I b'longs to.
Yas, seh.&quot;</p>

<p>The General sat back a little in his chair and
studied Uncle Billy. He saw that after all
the old negro was simply a natural slave&mdash;that
he probably had no other thought in his
grayed head than that of faithful service to his
owner. But he would try him and see how
far the old man would go.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand,&quot; he said, &quot;that freedom has
been offered you&mdash;and you refused it. Is this
true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yas, seh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Why?</i>&quot; asked the General quietly.</p>

<p>Uncle Billy stammered.</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;er&mdash;well, 'skuse me, Mars' Gen'l,
but&mdash;but down whar <i>I</i> lives at de&mdash;de white
gent'men understands a nigger better'n what
you-all does. Yas, seh.&quot;</p>

<p>General Grant may have smiled internally,
but the only symptom of amusement was the
dry note in his voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. But there has been some difference
of opinion on the point.&quot;</p>

<p>He paused and then pointed past Uncle
Billy directly at Morrison. &quot;Do you know
that man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me?&quot; said Uncle Billy. He turned and
saw Morrison and instantly his face lighted up.
It made no difference to the old negro that
Morrison's uniform was mutilated&mdash;he could
only see the familiar features of one who had
treated his dead mistress with perfect respect
under trying circumstances.</p>

<p>&quot;Aw, yas, seh,&quot; he broke out, with a broad
grin. &quot;How you does, Cun'l. I clar to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Billy stopped. His eyes had gone
beyond Morrison to the man sitting beside him
and at the sight of that loved figure the old
man began to tremble. His voice lowered to
a whisper and he began to totter forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Mars' Cary!&quot; he said, as if he were looking
on one risen from the dead. He came a
little nearer, with his hand stretched out as
if to touch him testingly&mdash;then suddenly
dropped down on his knees before Gary who
had risen from his chair. &quot;Bless Gawd, I
done fin' you,&quot; he sobbed, his face buried in his
toaster's coat. &quot;I done fin' you at last.&quot;</p>

<p>The General frowned.</p>

<p>&quot;Forbes,&quot; he ordered. &quot;Put a stop to that.
Bring him back!&quot;</p>

<p>But Uncle Billy paid not a bit of attention
as the Adjutant sprang up. All his thought
was for his master and his own explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;Dey wouldn' lemme git thru, seh!&quot; he cried,
pleading absolution from what had seemed an
inexcusable breach of trust. &quot;Dey wouldn'
gimme no pass an' I'se des been stuck! Aw,
Gawd, Mars' Cary&mdash;an' I axed 'em ev'y day!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There now, Billy&mdash;don't,&quot; Cary said with
a gesture of pity and unending gratitude.</p>

<p>Uncle Billy rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Yas, seh. Yas, seh,&quot; he answered obediently.
&quot;'Skuse me, Mars' Gen'l. I couldn'
he'p it, seh. I&mdash;I couldn' he'p it. Dey
wouldn' eben lemme see him in de guard
house&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That will do,&quot; interrupted the General
firmly. &quot;Listen to me. When did you see
Mr. Morrison&mdash;last?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Him?&quot; said Uncle Billy, looking around
at the Union officer. &quot;'Twas&mdash;'twas in de
spring, seh. Yas, seh. De time de Yankees
bu'nt us out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How's that?&quot; asked the General, not understanding.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Harris came forward a step.</p>

<p>&quot;The act of incendiarism I spoke of, General&mdash;on
the part of Sergeant Dudley.&quot;</p>

<p>The General looked up and nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; he said, and Harris, knowing that
due weight would be given the fact let go a
faint sigh of relief and stepped back.</p>

<p>The cigar came out of the General's mouth.
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; he said to Uncle Billy.</p>

<p>The old negro drew himself up and shifted
his weight onto his other foot.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, seh, 'twas dis way. One mornin' de
blue-bellies&mdash;'skuse me, seh, de cav'lry gent'men.
One mornin' de cav'lry gent'men come
ridin' up, lookin' fer horses an' fodder an'&mdash;an'
Mars' Cary&mdash;an' anything else what was
layin' roun'. Yas, seh. An' des' befo' dis
here gent'man come,&quot; with a bow at Morrison,
&quot;a low-lived white man took'n grab me by de
th'oat&mdash;an' choke me, seh. Den he 'sult Miss
Hallie&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Hallie?&quot; queried the General.</p>

<p>&quot;My mis'tiss, seh,&quot; answered Uncle Billy.
&quot;My mis'tiss, seh,&quot; he said again and his hand
went up to his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;The wife of Captain Cary,&quot; Harris said
in a low tone and the General nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Den&mdash;bless Gawd&mdash;de Cun'l come! He
pick him down offn de front po'ch&mdash;and put
him under 'rest. Yas, seh. An' Miss Hallie,
she sho' was hoppin', Gen'l. She&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind that,&quot; sighed the man whose
creed was Patience. &quot;Go on with the
story.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yas, seh. Thank'e, seh. 'Twas des lek I
tell you, seh. An' arfter while orders come
to de cav'lry gent'men fer to light out fr'm
dar in a hurry. An' whilst dey was gettin'
ready, seh, an' me an' de Cun'l was waitin'
roun' fer to proteck de property, de fire bus'
right out de winders!</p>

<p>&quot;Dat's right, Mars' Gen'l,&quot; Uncle Billy
hurried to state, as the General's eyebrows
went up in surprise. &quot;Dat's right. Den de
front do' flewed open, an' here come dat po'
white trash rapscallion&mdash;wid de pine knot in
his han'. Yas, <i>seh</i>. He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One moment!&quot; snapped the General.
&quot;Was he running <i>towards</i> his troop or <i>away</i>
from it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Way</i> fr'm it, seh,&quot; replied the old negro,
with unmistakable truthfulness, &quot;t'odes de
ice house whar Miss Hallie an' de chillun was
at. Yas, seh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Mr. Morrison tried to stop him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha!&quot; cried Uncle Billy, with a chuckle.
&quot;He mo'n tried, seh. He <i>done</i> it!&quot;</p>

<p>The General nodded, his lips tight shut.</p>

<p>&quot;So I understand. But what did he do&mdash;or
say?&quot;</p>

<p>At this question Uncle Billy suddenly developed
dramatic abilities that his master had
never dreamed of.</p>

<p>&quot;He say&mdash;&quot; and Uncle Billy's arm shot out
as he pointed something deadly at an invisible
foe&mdash;&quot;he say, '<i>Halt! Dudley! Halt! Bang!</i>'&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Billy's hat dropped down on the floor
with a whack. &quot;Dat's all, seh. Dat po' white
trash&mdash;he drop lek a stuck pig, seh!&quot;</p>

<p>The General's eyes were on his desk and for
a moment there was a pause. Finally, he
lifted his head and looked at Morrison, who
rose in salute.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Morrison. You did well. Your
Sergeant failed in his military duty&mdash;and deserved
the punishment. I commend your
action.&quot;</p>

<p>Harris, listening with all his might, thought
the words more favorable than the tone in
which they were spoken and his face brightened.
Then he heard the General speaking
more sternly.</p>

<p>&quot;The Federal powers of administrative
justice now occupy precisely the same position
with regard to your own default.&quot;</p>

<p>Harris' face darkened. After the first just
encomium&mdash;what was this that was coming?</p>

<p>Relentless and inflexible the voice went on.</p>

<p>&quot;The rules of war, as applied to a non-commissioned
officer, must also govern his superiors.
As Sergeant Dudley deserved his bullet
you merit <i>yours</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>His eyes dropped from Morrison's face and
he looked up at Harris.</p>

<p>&quot;A bad witness for your client, Lieutenant,&quot;
he said grimly, as he nodded his head
towards Uncle Billy. &quot;You ought to study
law! Take him away,&quot; and he picked up a
fresh cigar from a box in front of him and
tossed the old one out of the window.</p>

<p>Uncle Billy, with a puzzled look on his face,
slowly yielded to the touch of the two soldiers
who stepped into the room at a gesture from
Forbes. He seemed to realize that his testimony
had not been of much avail though just
why was indeed a mystery. One thing, however,
was quite clear.</p>

<p>&quot;'Skuse me, Mars' Gen'l. I&mdash;I don't need
dat ar pass home now. An' I much obliged
to you fer <i>not</i> givin' it to me. Yas, seh.
Thank'e, seh.&quot; At the doorway he bowed
with careful politeness to each occupant of the
fatal room. &quot;Good mornin', Mars' Cary.
Good mornin', gent'men. <i>Good</i> mornin'.&quot;</p>

<p>With the disappearance of bewildered
Uncle Billy the General swung around on
the officer who no longer wore his shoulder
straps.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Morrison,&quot; he said, in his distinct,
even tones. &quot;Your friend and counsel, Lieutenant
Harris, has applied to me for your pardon!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Pardon?</i>&quot; cried Morrison, springing to his
feet with an exclamation of amazement.</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; was the crisp response. &quot;It
comes from him&mdash;not from you. But still, as
an interested party, have you anything to say
in your own behalf?&quot;</p>

<p>The Union officer stared at his general for
a moment without replying. Yes, there were
many things that might be said&mdash;all of them
honest arguments in his own behalf, all of
them weighted with Right and Humanity
but none of them worth putting into words in
the face of this deadly machine of war, this
grim, austere, unyielding tribunal. He wavered
for a moment on his feet as a terrible
wave of despair surged over him, then made a
faint gesture of negation.</p>

<p>&quot;I have nothing to say, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Captain Cary!&quot; ordered the General and,
as Cary rose unsteadily to his feet, &quot;No.
Keep your seat, sir; you are wounded. Is it
true&mdash;as I learn from this report&mdash;that during
a skirmish a week ago you helped defend the
Union colors against your own people?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary shot up from his chair with a fiery
rush of anger.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>I? No, sir!</i> I defended the <i>man</i>&mdash;not
the soldier, or his flag!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; ejaculated the General, leaning back
in his chair and blowing out a cloud of smoke
in surprise. &quot;You draw a rather fine distinction,
Captain. You saved the colors&mdash;<i>but
you failed to save the man!</i> You had better
have let him die&mdash;as an honorable soldier.&quot;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and the General
asked: &quot;Is it true that you were actuated
by a debt of gratitude?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the Southerner, throwing
back his head. &quot;And a greater debt than I
can ever hope to pay. His mercy to&mdash;my
little girl.&quot;</p>

<p>Without relaxing for a moment his grip on
the points of the case, no matter what human
elements might be drawn into it, the General
instantly rose and shot out an accusing forefinger
at the Confederate.</p>

<p>&quot;And the pass he gave&mdash;<i>to you!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Their eyes clashed but the Southerner lowered
his own not a whit and backed them, furthermore,
with honest anger.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>To her!</i>&quot; he answered, and drove the reply
home with clenched jaws.</p>

<p>The General relaxed&mdash;and smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;Another fine distinction,&quot; he said, resuming
his seat. He knocked the ashes from his
cigar and presently looked up with another
one of those terribly vital questions which
came so simply from his lips. &quot;Did you ever
penetrate the Federal lines by means of a uniform&mdash;of
blue?&quot;</p>

<p>The Confederate drew back as he felt the
assault on his rights as a soldier.</p>

<p>&quot;As to that, General Grant, there is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Answer me!&quot; came the sharp command.
&quot;'Yes' or 'No'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One moment, General,&quot; interrupted Harris,
with a lawyer's quick objection. &quot;If&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No interference, Harris,&quot; came the curt
order. &quot;Answer me, Captain. 'Yes' or
'No'!&quot;</p>

<p>The Southerner's face flushed and he threw
back his head with the superb defiance that
General Grant knew so well&mdash;which was his
one eternal stumbling block, and due to continue
for another full year of blood.</p>

<p>&quot;Under the rulings of court-martial law,&quot;
the Confederate Captain said in ringing tones,
&quot;I deny even <i>your</i> right to the question.&quot;</p>

<p>To the surprise of everyone the General
merely nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;That is all, sir. Thank you,&quot; he said, and
Cary, with a look of surprise, slowly resumed
his seat.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Morrison!&quot;</p>

<p>The Union officer rose and saluted.</p>

<p>&quot;As a military servant of the United States
Government you were ordered to pursue this
man and take him&mdash;dead or alive. In this
you failed.&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison inclined his head gravely but shot
a look of respectful objection at his superior.</p>

<p>&quot;In part&mdash;I failed.&quot;</p>

<p>Instantly the accusing forefinger was
leveled at him across the desk and the point
made with terrible directness.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>And knowing he was a spy!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Not to my personal knowledge, sir. I
hunted him many times; but never while he
wore a Federal uniform.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And when you captured him?&quot;</p>

<p>In reply, Morrison simply indicated Cary's
tattered coat of gray.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! Then you <i>did</i> capture him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; came the quiet answer.</p>

<p>&quot;And he <i>was</i> the escort mentioned in your
pass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Morrison answered slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;H'm,&quot; said the General. He rose and
turned to Harris.</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid, my dear Harris, that in spite
of fine spun distinctions and your legal technicalities,
the findings of our court were not far
wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Dropping his handful of papers on the desk
he caught Morrison's eye and rasped out his
analysis of the case.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain Cary practically admits his guilt!
<i>You</i> were aware of it! And yet you send him
through the very center of our lines! A <i>pass</i>!
Carte blanche to learn the disposition of our
forces&mdash;our weakness and our strength&mdash;and
to make his report in Richmond. He was an
enemy&mdash;with a price on his head! And you
trusted him! <i>A spy!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>As the General had been speaking the first
few words of his contemptuous summing up
Morrison saw where they would lead and his
manhood instantly leaped up in reply.</p>

<p>&quot;I trusted, not the spy, but <i>Herbert Cary</i>,&quot;
he said with honest courage. Then, as the
General turned his back on him with a contemptuous
snap of his fingers&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;General! I have offered no defense. If
the justice of court-martial law prescribes a
firing squad&mdash;I find no fault. I failed. I
pay.&quot;</p>

<p>With a gesture which indicated Gary the
disgraced officer of the Army of the Potomac
shot out his one and only defense of
his action&mdash;at an unyielding back.</p>

<p>&quot;I took this man&mdash;hunted&mdash;wounded&mdash;fighting
to reach the side of a hungry child.
I captured him and, by the rules of war, I was
about to have him shot. Then he asked me to
get his little girl safely to Richmond, and not
to let her know&mdash;about him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And she believed in <i>me</i>. <i>Trusted</i> me&mdash;even
as I trusted Herbert Cary to pierce the
very center of your lines&mdash;as a father&mdash;not a
spy!&quot;</p>

<p>From behind the unyielding back came a
statement of fact, firm and pitiless.</p>

<p>&quot;And it cost you your sword&mdash;your life.&quot;</p>

<p>Morrison centered his eyes on the back of
the General's head and sent his answer home
with all the power of his voice and spirit.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>And I have no regret</i>&quot; he said. &quot;In the
duty of a military servant&mdash;I have failed.
But my prisoner still lives! I could <i>not</i> accept
the confidence of his child&mdash;the trust of
innocence&mdash;a baby's kiss&mdash;with the blood of
her father on my hands!&quot; He dropped his
hands and half turned away.</p>

<p>The General turned, a little at a time&mdash;first
his head and then his shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;A very pretty sentiment,&quot; he remarked
dryly. &quot;But you seem to forget that we are
not making love but <i>war</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>With a supreme burst of anger at his helplessness
before the brute forces which would
presently send him forth to the firing squad,
Morrison wheeled on his commanding general
and flared forth with his last reply.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, <i>war</i>! And the hellish laws that govern
it. But there is another law&mdash;<i>Humanity</i>!
Through a trooper in my command the home
of an enemy was turned to ashes&mdash;his loved
ones flung out to starve. When a helpless tot
had lost its mother and a father would protect
it, then <i>war</i> demands that I smash a baby's
one last hope&mdash;in the name of the Stars and
Stripes. And then&mdash;to march back home, to
a happy, triumphant North&mdash;and meet <i>my</i>
baby&mdash;with the memory of a butcher in my
heart&mdash;<i>By Heaven, sir! I'd rather hang!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment General and Colonel regarded
each other fixedly and then the General
turned away to pace the floor. Presently
he came to his decision and walked slowly back
to his desk.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant Harris,&quot; he said in tones whose
significance could not be misunderstood, &quot;I
was right. You have wasted your time&mdash;and
mine.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he sighed wearily and made a last gesture
to Forbes.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>The guard</i>&quot; he said.</p>

<p>It was all over.</p>

<p>And then, to the ears of the two prisoners
who stood looking at one another with sad
eyes, came a sound which made both men
start and look again with apprehension written
on their faces&mdash;the shrill scream of a child
who is being kept from something she has set
her heart upon. Another moment and there
was a rush of tiny feet in the hall, whereupon
the two sentries crossed their rifles across the
doorway. But what might have proved a serious
obstruction for a man was only an absurdity
to a child's quick wit and Virgie, with a
little duck of her sunny head, dodged quickly
under the muskets and charged, flushed and
panting, on the General's desk.</p>

<p>&quot;You shan't shoot Colonel Morrison,&quot; cried
this astonishing new comer in tones of shrill
command as she stamped her little foot:
&quot;I won't let you! You shan't! You
shan't!&quot;</p>

<p>A moment of displeased surprise on the
part of the General. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Take the child out of here,&quot; he ordered.</p>

<p>&quot;I won't <i>go</i>!&quot; answered Virgie, tossing her
curls back and standing her ground with'
angry eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Orderly!&quot; called the General.</p>

<p>With a whirl Virgie dashed away from the
desk, eluded the orderly and threw herself into
her father's arms.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Daddy, Daddy! You won't let him
shoot the Colonel. Daddy, you won't! You
won't!&quot; She burst into a passionate flood of
tears.</p>

<p>Cary lifted his hand to the General in a plea
for a moment's respite from force.</p>

<p>&quot;General&mdash;please. She'll go.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned to the sobbing child and shook
her gently. &quot;Virgie! Virgie! Listen, honey!
<i>Remember General Lee!</i>&quot; The bowed head
rose from her father's shoulder; the little
shoulders stiffened, and eye to eye she looked
into the face of Cary as his pleading voice went
on: &quot;<i>He</i> wouldn't want you to cry like this.
He said&mdash;'She's a brave little soldier to stay
there all alone. Dixie and I are <i>proud</i> of
her.'&quot;</p>

<p>The Littlest Rebel's chin went up, and she
bravely choked back her sobs. If this was
what her General wanted, this her General
would have, though childhood's sobs are hard
to check when a little heart is aching for the
pain of those she loves.</p>

<p>&quot;Go now, darling,&quot; her father pleaded.
&quot;Go.&quot;</p>

<p>She kissed him, and turned in silent, slow
obedience, casting a scowl at the grim and
silent General Grant, then moved toward the
guarded door.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; said a quiet voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Harris! They say that fools and children
speak the truth.&quot; He paused and then said
gently: &quot;Come here, little girl. Come here
and talk to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Somewhat in fear now that the kind voice
robbed her of her anger the little pale faced
child choked down her sobs and came slowly
forward to the desk. But, as she stood there,
her courage returned and, marvel of marvels,
her tiny hand went up in imitation of a salute.</p>

<p>Grant dropped his chin in his hand so that
their heads were nearly on a level across his
desk and looked at her with gentle kindness
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;The Littlest Rebel, eh?&quot; he said in low
tones. &quot;How old are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;S-s-s-even. Goin' on eight,&quot; responded
Virgie, gulping down a sob and nervously fingering
her tattered dress.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; he nodded. &quot;And do you know
the uniform of a Union officer&mdash;when you see
it?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie's small mouth dropped open at the
absurdity of the question and she almost
laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;A Yankee?&quot; she queried with scorn.
&quot;Well, I reckon I <i>ought</i> to&mdash;by <i>this</i> time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; the brown bearded man
nodded, and gently blew smoke at the ceiling.
&quot;Now, tell me. When you lived at
home&mdash;and afterwards in your cabin&mdash;did
your father come to see you often?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie's sunny head nodded in emphatic
asseveration. &quot;Yes, sir. Often.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>How</i> often?&quot; asked the bearded man.</p>

<p>Virgie's fingers twisted themselves deep in
her dress.</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I don't know, sir. But heaps of
times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good again,&quot; and the questioner actually
smiled. &quot;When your father came, did he ever
wear clothes that&mdash;that were not his own?&quot;</p>

<p>Virgie turned a side-long look on her father
but, as he could not help, her puzzled eyes
went back to the General.</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;well, lots of our men don't have
hardly <i>any</i> clo's,&quot; she said pathetically.</p>

<p>Another smile broke the sternness of the
General's face.</p>

<p>&quot;That isn't what I mean,&quot; he explained
gently. &quot;Did he ever wear a coat of blue&mdash;a
<i>Yankee</i> uniform?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>General</i>!&quot; broke in Harris.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant!&quot; Grant frowned. He turned
back to Virgie and coaxed her a little.</p>

<p>&quot;Well? Tell me!&quot;</p>

<p>With one bare big toe twisted under her
foot and fingers interlocked in agony the child
turned a look of pure anguish on her silent,
grave faced father. This was torture&mdash;and
she could not escape.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Daddy, Daddy!&quot; she burst forth with
a wail of tragedy in her voice. &quot;<i>What must
I tell him</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>The father's lips, which had been closed
against the pain that racked him, softened with
the perfect trust which went into his gentle
command.</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>truth</i>, Virgie. Whatever the General
asks.&quot;</p>

<p>The General's observant eyes rested on the
proud Southerner for an instant, noted that
his face was quite without anxiety, then went
back to the little child.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, did he?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Y-y-y-es, sir,&quot; answered Virgie with a
gulp.</p>

<p>The General nodded and his face grew grave
again.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if you even know what it means.
A <i>spy</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the Littlest Rebel, and
dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Hm. And do you remember how many
times he came that way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; came the instant answer, and she
threw up her head. &quot;<i>Once</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Once?</i>&quot; echoed the General, surprised.
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she answered. She drew herself
up proudly, forgetting the poor, tattered dress,
and her clear eyes rested fearlessly on two
others that read through them down into the
pure whiteness of her soul.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Think!</i>&quot; said the quiet voice again, while
the perspiration started out on the forehead
of more than one listener. &quot;And remember
what your father said just now. When was
it?&quot;</p>

<p>Again the fearless eyes of the child, the
Littlest Rebel of them all, rose to the gaze
of the man whose iron heel was crushing them
into the ground and she made her answer&mdash;as
crystal clear and truthful as if she stood before
the Throne on the last great day.</p>

<p>&quot;When&mdash;when Daddy came through the
woods an'&mdash;an' put my mamma in the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence. No one moved. Outside
in the trees and bushes the song the summer
insects were singing suddenly burst upon,
their ears and the myriad noises of the camp,
hitherto unnoticed, became a veritable clamor,
so complete was the stillness in the room.
Everyone except, perhaps, the child herself
realized the vital importance of her answer
and now that it had been given the crisis had
passed. The Littlest Rebel had put an end to
questioning. An audible sigh went up from
everyone except the man behind the desk.</p>

<p>This one turned his head slowly towards the
Confederate prisoner.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain Cary, is this true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, General,&quot; came the straightforward
answer. &quot;I went to your nearest post with a
flag of truce and asked permission to go to my
dead wife. I was refused. I went <i>without</i>
permission.&quot;</p>

<p>General Grant rose to his feet. Centering
the other's eyes with his own he spoke to him
as one officer speaks to another when he expects
the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>&quot;And you give me your word, as a soldier
and a gentleman, that once&mdash;once <i>only</i>&mdash;you
wore a Federal uniform and that because of
the burial of your wife?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do,&quot; answered Herbert Cary, a rebel to
the last. &quot;And that was the only cause in
heaven or hell that could have <i>induced</i> me to
wear it!&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment the Commander of the Army
of the Potomac surveyed the still defiant
prisoner, then turned his back and walked to
the window where he tossed away a much
chewed cigar, meantime thinking out his last
analysis.</p>

<p>Here was a man who had been hunted tirelessly
month after month as a rebel spy. It
was true that he was a spy and true that he
had worn a uniform of blue. Yet the fact had
been established&mdash;by the spotless honesty of a
little child&mdash;that he had worn the uniform only
so that he might reach his home and bury his
dead. And&mdash;went on the cool, quiet mind&mdash;since
the man was <i>not</i> a spy how could a Union
officer be executed for assisting a <i>spy</i> to escape?</p>

<p>Coming back to his desk again the General
picked out another smoke, felt of it thoughtfully,
sniffed at it, then raised his quiet eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison,&quot; he said in
clear, incisive tones, &quot;<i>go back to your command!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Five words. Five short, plain words, yet
they made all the difference between a firing
squad and a chance at life again. There was
a silence&mdash;then a gasp from Morrison's dry
throat. At the sound of his title&mdash;at the
sound of that blessed order which, by right of
supreme power, instantly restored him to his
rank, the Union officer leaped to his feet with
a cry of joy. But it was not even for those
around him in that little room to know the
wonderful vista of happiness which opened up
again before the eyes which only a moment ago
had been doomed to close in the sleep of a disgraceful
death.</p>

<p>The General's hand went up in a gesture
which checked his gratitude.</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>next</i> time you are forced to decide
between military duty and humanity&mdash;think
twice!&quot;</p>

<p>He turned to his desk and took up a small
piece of paper, crumpled and torn.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain Cary,&quot; he said, &quot;I sincerely regret
that I cannot honor the pass as given you by
Colonel Morrison,&quot; and he turned the paper
over, &quot;but I do honor the pass of your General&mdash;R.E.
Lee.&quot;</p>

<p>He folded the paper and held it out to Cary
who came forward as if in a dream. Then
the General turned his back again and began
to rummage on his desk. The incident was
closed.</p>

<p>But there was a rush of bare, childish feet
sand before he could escape Virgie's brown
little arms were round him and her dimpled
chin was pressed against his waist.</p>

<p>The General made no effort to release himself
but looked down on her with a softer light
in his face than any of his men had seen there
in many months.</p>

<p>&quot;And as for you, young lady, the next time
you pervert my officers and upset the discipline
of the Federal Army&mdash;well, I don't know
<i>what</i> I'll do with you.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked down into her face and read there
a wistful feminine appeal for outward and visible
reconciliation.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well,&quot; he said with mock resignation,
&quot;I suppose I've got to do it,&quot; and he stooped
and kissed her. Then he took up his campaign
hat and walked towards the door.</p>

<p>Behind him the child in her tattered dress
and bare brown legs stood still and threw out
her arms to him in a last soft-voiced good-by.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Gen'ral,&quot; called the Littlest
Rebel, with the light of heaven in her eyes.
&quot;Thank you for Daddy and Colonel Morrison
and <i>me</i>. You're another mighty good damn
Yankee!&quot;</p>

<p>And then, with a cry of surpassing joy and
love, she rushed back to where the two men
waited for her on their knees.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>In the shade of a fringe of trees that edged
the river bank a troop of cavalry was drawn
up in one long, thin line. Knee to knee, the
silent, blue-coated riders sat, waiting, waiting&mdash;not
for a charge upon the enemy, or orders
for a foray through an already harried land.
They waited for a leader&mdash;a man who had led
them through the heat and cold, through peaceful
valleys and the bloody ruck of battle; a
man whom they loved and trusted, fearing him
only when they shirked a duty or disobeyed the
iron laws of war.</p>

<p>This man had been taken from them, himself
a servant who had disobeyed these laws,
his sword dishonored, his shoulder straps
ripped off before their eyes. And now the
troopers waited&mdash;and for what? An order
had come which put them on review, a long
thin line of horsemen waiting on the river
bank, while the sun beat down on the parched
red fields, and the waters of the muddy James
lazed by as they murmured their sad, low song.</p>

<p>The troopers were silent&mdash;waiting. A horse
stamped idly in the dust, and a saber rattled
against a booted leg. A whisper ran down
the line. The eyes of the men turned slowly
at the sight of a single rider who advanced
from the distant Union camp. He did not
take the dusty road which swept in a wide,
half-circle to where the waiting troopers sat
in line, but jumped a low worm-fence and
came straight across the fields.</p>

<p>An officer he was, erect in his saddle, chin
up and shoulders squared. On his shoulders
his straps had been replaced, and his saber
rattled against his thigh to the rise and fall of
his horse's stride.</p>

<p>Straight on he came till he checked his
mount before the center of the waiting line,
and the troopers knew that Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrison had once more come into his own.</p>

<p>Their sabers rasped from out the scabbards
and rose in a joyous, swift salute, while Morrison's
once dishonored sword acknowledged it.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>'Tention</i> ...<i>company!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>The long line stiffened and waited for their
officer to speak; yet the voice was not the voice
of an officer in command, but that of a comrade
and a friend.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, boys! It's good to be back
again.&quot; He swallowed something in his
throat and struggled manfully to speak in even
tones. &quot;I must ask you to be quiet&mdash;and not
to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped. Again his troop had disobeyed
him&mdash;disobeyed him to a man. A
shout went up, deep, joyous and uncontrolled,
its echoes pulsing out across the hot, red fields
till it reached the distant camp; and Grant
looked up from a war map's crisscross lines,
grunted, and lit a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>And Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison sat his
horse before his cheering line of men, silent,
happy, while two tears rolled, unheeded, down
his cheek&mdash;a soldier and a man!</p>

<p>His tenderness to a little child had torn him
from his saddle and doomed him to disgrace
and death; and then, one line from her baby
lips had mounted him again and set him before
his troopers on parade.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>It was when ... Daddy came through the
woods ... and put my mamma ... in the
ground</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Two lives she had held&mdash;in her little hands&mdash;and
had saved them both with a dozen words
of simple, unfaltering truth.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the dusty pike which led to Virginia's
capital another rider plodded through the
heat and haze. His coat, once gray, now hung
in mud-stained tatters about his form, but beneath
his battered campaign hat his thin, pale
features were smoothed by a smile of happiness.</p>

<p>Behind his saddle, one hand gripped tightly
in a rent in the soiled gray coat, sat still
another Rebel&mdash;the smallest of them all&mdash;her
tiny legs stretched out almost straight on the
horse's wide, fat back.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy&mdash;how far is it to Richmon' now?&quot;</p>

<p>The rider turned his head and pointed north.</p>

<p>&quot;It's close now, honey. See that line of
hills? That's Richmond. A mile or two and
we'll be at home.&quot;</p>

<p>Again they plodded on, past fields of shriveled
corn whose stalks stood silently in parched
and wilted lines&mdash;lines that were like the ranks
of the doomed Confederacy&mdash;its stalks erect,
yet sapped of the juice of life. Where
orchards once had flourished their rotted
branches now hid mouths of rifle pits, and low,
red clay entrenchments stretched across the
fields.</p>

<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; broke out a piping voice, &quot;don't
you think we'd better make this Yankee horse
get up a little? 'Cause&mdash;'cause somethin' <i>else</i>
might happen before we get there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right, Virgie,&quot; her father answered,
with a pat on her small, brown knee. &quot;These
lines are ours, and I reckon we are safe at
last.&quot;</p>

<p>They were. Two Rebels on a Yankee horse
soon made their triumphant entry into Richmond.
They passed through Rockets, by the
half-deserted wharves on the river bank where
a crippled gunboat lay, then clattered over the
cobble stones up Main Street till they reached
the Square. On the State House the Stars
and Bars still floated; but the travelers did not
pause. Northward they turned, then westward
again, till they stopped at last before a
silent, stately mansion, the headquarters of
their General&mdash;General Lee.</p>

<p>Before the open door two sentries stood, but
as Cary and his charge dismounted an orderly
came down the steps and out of the iron gate.
A word or two from Cary and the orderly disappeared
into the house, returning soon with
word that the visitors would be received&mdash;at
once.</p>

<p>Up the stone steps went Virgie, holding
tightly to her father's hand, for now, as she
neared her General, her little heart was pounding,
and her breath came eagerly and fast.</p>

<p>On the threshold of a dim and shaded room
they paused and looked. He sat there, at a
table strewn with war maps and reports&mdash;a
tall gray man in a coat of gray&mdash;the soldier
and the gentleman.</p>

<p>As father and child came in he rose to meet
them, looking at the two with eyes that seemed
to hold the sadness and the tenderness of all
the world.</p>

<p>He knew their story; in fact, he had bent his
every effort to the saving of Cary's life. He
had sent a courier to the camp of General
Grant below the city, asking a stay of sentence
till the facts in the case were cleared; and only
a half hour before his courier had returned
with news of the prisoner's release.</p>

<p>And now, as he advanced and gave a courtly
welcome to his trusted scout, the hand of the
Littlest Rebel once more went up in salute to
a superior officer.</p>

<p>&quot;Gen'ral,&quot; she said, as she stole a glance at
her father's smiling face, &quot;I've brought him
back&mdash;with&mdash;with the pass you gave me, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>And the General stooped&mdash;six feet of him&mdash;till
his lips were on a level with Virgie's lips;
then folded her closely into his great gray
arms.</p>

Hushed is the rolling drum. The bugle's note<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breathes but an echo of its martial blast;</span><br />
The proud old flags, in mourning silence, float<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the heroes of a buried past.</span><br />
Frail ivy vines 'round rusting cannon creep;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tattered pennants droop against the wall;</span><br />
The war-worn warriors are sunk in sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond a summons of the trumpet's call.</span><br />
<br />
Do ye still dream, ye voiceless, slumbering ones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of glories gained through struggles fierce and long,</span><br />
Lulled by the muffled boom of ghostly guns<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That weave the music of a battle-song?</span><br />
In fitful flight do misty visions reel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While restless chargers toss their bridle-reins?</span><br />
When down the lines gleam points of polished steel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And phantom columns flood the sun-lit plains?</span><br />
<br />
A breathless hush! A shout that mounts on high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till every hoary hill from sleep awakes!</span><br />
Swift as the unleashed lightning cleaves the sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tumbling, tempest-rush of battle breaks!</span><br />
The smoke-wreathed cannon launch their hell-winged shells!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rattling crash of musketry's sharp sound</span><br />
Sinks in the deafening din of hoarse, wild yells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And squadrons charging o'er the trampled ground!</span><br />
<br />
Down, down they rush! The cursing riders reel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Neath tearing shot and savage bayonet-thrust;</span><br />
A plunging charger stamps with iron heel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His dying master in the battle's dust.</span><br />
The shrill-tongued notes of victory awake!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The black guns thunder back the shout amain!</span><br />
In crimson-crested waves the columns break,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like shattered foam, across the shell-swept plain.</span><br />
<br />
A still form lies upon the death-crowned hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With sightless eyes, gray lips that may not speak.</span><br />
His dead hand holds his shot-torn banner still&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its proud folds pressed against his bloodstained cheek.</span><br />
<br />
O slumbering heroes, cease to dream of war!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let hatreds die behind the tread of years.</span><br />
Forget the past, like some long-vanished scar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose smart is healed in drops of falling tears.</span><br />
Keep, keep your glory; but forget the strife!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Roll up your battle-flags so stained and torn!</span><br />
Teach, teach our hearts, that still dream on in life,<br />

From pitying Heaven a pitying angel came.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smiling, she bade the tongues of conflict cease.</span><br />
Her wide wings fanned away the smoke and flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hushed the red battle's roar. God called her Peace.</span><br />
From land and sea she swept mad passion's glow;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet left a laurel for the hero's fame.</span><br />
She whispered hope to hearts in grief bowed low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And taught our lips, in love, to shape her name.</span><br />

Peace spreads her pinions wide from South to North;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dead enmity within the grave is laid.</span><br />
The church towers ring their holy anthems forth,<br />

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
